Many of Kingston's playgrounds offer inclusive play experiences. Even more accessible features can be found at City Park, Memorial Centre Park, Rotary Park, Lake Ontario Park and Welborne Park.  Accessibility Plan  The 2023-2025 Multi-Year Accessibility Plan is designed to complement and to be an extension of past plans and accessibility updates. This document includes strategies that will help make the City of Kingston more accessible to all its residents and visitors ensuring the accessibility standards under the AODA are fully implemented by 2025.

Submit a Nomination  Award Criteria   Eligible nominees for a Kingston Celebrating Accessibility Award are: Kingston residents, organizations, or businesses, who have had a positive impact on accessibility in Kingston.  Nominees whose paid employment or educational requirements include an accessibility component are not eligible for the award unless they demonstrate exceptional accomplishment.  The achievement should reflect a nominee's positive impact on accessibility in the past three years (2020 to 2022).  The selection of awards will be based on the information submitted with the nomination form. When submitting the nomination, nominators can submit additional information including letters of support, testimonials, pictures, drawings, etc.  Incomplete and/or late nominations will be accepted at the sole discretion of the committee.   Award Categories  Awards will be given out in the following three categories: Business, Community Member and Community Organization .  As part of the application process, nominees will be asked to identify the area(s) that their nominee’s work best reflects:  Built Environment: a building, interior, or outdoor space purposely designed, modified, or renovated to eliminate barriers and/or enhance access for people with disabilities.  Customer Service: breaking down barriers that prevent customers with disabilities from accessing the services they need. Barriers include physical/architectural, technological, information or communication, organizational and attitudinal.  Design of Public Spaces: making communal spaces, such as trails, beaches, rest stops, outdoor play spaces, accessible parking, or outdoor paths of travel more accessible.  Education: identifying and removing barriers to student participation in learning at all levels from kindergarten to post-secondary and adult education.  Employment: employers making their workplace practices accessible to potential or current workers with disabilities.  Health Care: making the health care system more accessible to patients with disabilities as well as any patients’ support people.  Information and Communication: creating, providing, and receiving information and communications that people with disabilities can access. Accessible information and communication provide all people an equal chance to learn and be active in their communities.  Transportation: making the features and equipment on transportation services, including routes and vehicles, accessible to passengers with disabilities.  Selection committee  The award's selection committee chooses the finalist from amongst the nominations received.

The City's pet and animal regulations are intended to ensure the safety and well-being of pets – and to safeguard members of the community, including domestic pets, from unexpected encounters with wildlife and uncontrolled animals.  Pets and other animals deserve our respect, kind consideration and responsible stewardship.  Learn more about responsible pet ownership, including:   How to license your pet   Animal & Pet Control rules and frequently asked questions   How to use off-leash dog parks   How to properly keep backyard hens        Responsible Pet Ownership    Responding to Wildlife      In Kingston, animal control is regulated by the City. To report dog and cat infractions email bylaw enforcement .   Lost and Found Pets  There are several resources available to pet owners who have lost a pet in the Kingston Area.  You can contact the Kingston Humane Society with a photo and short description of the missing animal, or check if your animal has been found by calling 613-546-1291.  You can also consider posting to a classified advertising service or a local lost and found pets group on social media or going door-to-door and sharing a photo of flyer in your neighbourhood.  If you are caring for an animal that you believe is lost, you can drive it to the Kingston Humane Society.  If you encounter an animal that you believe is lost, please do not approach the animal.

Below is a summary of rules and regulations for pet owners in the City.  Permitted Animals  To ensure the safety of all residents and other animals, the City has introduced a list of permitted animals:   Domestic dogs, cats, rabbits, ferrets, birds, amphibians and fish  Hens, according to Schedule C of the Animal Bylaw  Pigeons, according to Schedule D of the Animal Bylaw  Rodents  Pot-bellied, or other mini pigs  Sugar gliders  Hedgehogs  Raptors where the owner is licensed by the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources and Forestry  Reptiles, excluding snakes and members of the order crocodilian, that are non-venomous and do not reach an adult length greater than two metres  Snakes that are non-venomous, non-constricting and do not reach an adult length greater than 3 metres  Tarantulas and spiders that are non-venomous  Livestock, according to Section 11 of the Animal Bylaw  Ducks and geese on agricultural property or in rural areas  Service animals as outlined in the Provincial Animal Welfare Services Act.   Non-permitted species may be rehomed through the safe surrender program.  Dogs   Animals, including dogs, cannot be tethered on public property for more than 15 minutes and cannot be tethered on public property during extreme weather events (such as extreme heat or cold).  Dogs must be kept on a leash when not on their owner’s property, unless in a designated off-leash area. There are no maximum leash lengths.  Unlicensed and unvaccinated dogs are not permitted in off-leash dog parks.  All dogs within the City of Kingston (including rural areas) must be licensed.  Excessive barking is addressed under the City's Noise Bylaw .   Cats   Outdoor cats are not permitted to trespass on private property when outside.  Cats in the urban area are required to be licensed.   Backyard Hens  Kingston residents are allowed to keep up to six hens in their yard provided they follow the Backyard Hens Rules . To keep hens residents must register annually by completing the Backyard Hens Application . Applicants are also required to complete the Neighbour Notification Form .  Applications must be submitted in person at 1211 John Counter Boulevard.  Those considering keeping backyard hens will need to fully understand the applicable regulations and responsibilities.  Additional regulations   Advertising the sale of dogs, cats or rabbits is prohibited, unless by a licensed breeder, operator of a pet store or an established rescue agency.  Pigeon-keeping regulations have been introduced and are outlined in Schedule D of the Animal Bylaw .     Safe Surrender Program  The Municipal Fee Assistance Program (MFAP) has been temporarily expanded to include a Safe Surrender Program. Eligible residents can apply for a voucher of up to $2,000 to assist with costs related to the extraction or removal of the non-permitted species and associated re-homing costs. Veterinary costs would not be covered and a surrender agreement will be required between the owner of the prohibited species and the surrender agency.  The City will assist residents in contacting an appropriate agency to help with rehoming and residents seeking to rehome a non-permitted species through MFAP would not be fined. The Safe Surrender Program will be in place until the end of 2022.  Interested residents should contact Housing and Social Services at 613-546-2695 ext. 4906.

Licensing your pet  Pet licenses help keep your pet and other community members safe! All dogs in any part of the City and any cats residing in the urban area must be licensed annually.  Free initial licensing will be provided to dogs and cats that are under the age of 6 months or dogs and cats over the age of 6 months that have been spayed or neutered. See the pet license rates .     Pet Licenses      Micro-chipping your pet is also a good way to ensure they can be brought home if they are lost. The City offers reduced rates on licences for pets that are microchipped.   Spaying and neutering your pet  Spaying and neutering pets helps control the number of animals in shelters and on the streets. Residents who spay/neuter their pets also receive reduced rates for pet licences.   Veterinarians in Kingston offer spay neutering services. You can contact their offices directly for prices.  The City's responsible pet ownership program offers a limited number of $250 vouchers to help low-income households spay or neuter their pets. Households on a low income can apply for the vouchers through the City's Municipal Fee Assistance Program (MFAP). Limited number of vouchers available.  The Lanark Leeds & Grenville Spay Neuter Clinic operates a high-volume, low-cost spay-neuter clinic located in Brockville. View the prices and booking information .    Preventing your pet from becoming a threat or nuisance  Pet owners have responsibilities under the City's Animal Bylaw and Ontario's Dog Owners' Liability Act . While you may know and trust your pet, other residents might not. Please be considerate of others when taking your pets to a public space.    Dogs must be kept on a leash at all times, except when they are on your property or on the property of someone who has given permission for your dog to go unleashed.  Cats do not have to wear a leash; however, cats in the urban area will not be allowed to trespass on another person's property.  Pick up and properly dispose of your pet's waste, both on and off your property.  Ensure your dog does not bite, injure, chase, threaten, or disturb anyone.    Get your pet ethically and from a credible source  Having a pet means a commitment for the lifetime of that pet. Do your research on your potential pet's physical needs and what to expect for food, care and medical costs. Be aware of the type of training, socialization and exercise that will be needed and be sure that you are able to provide all of these things for your pet. Once an informed decision is made, it is important that you get your new pet from a rescue organization (such as the Kingston Humane Society ) or a breeder that is both credible and humane.  The City licenses dog, cat and rabbit breeders in Kingston. If you are purchasing a pet from a breeder, make sure to ask to see their licence. This will protect you and your family and ensures your breeder follows all the appropriate City bylaws.

The City of Kingston declared a climate emergency in 2019.  Kingston was the first Ontario municipality to do so. The City is committed to accelerating local efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  You can have an impact. Residential energy use accounted for an estimated 19 per cent of community greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in Kingston in 2019.  Working together. Through the Better Homes Kingston Program, the City aims to help retrofit 20 to 50 per cent of single-family homes built prior to 1991, by 2040.  Retrofits are good for our environment, your health and the economy. An energy-efficient home is healthier to live in, more resilient, more climate-friendly, and reduces money spent on energy and energy used. An increased demand for home energy retrofits will also create local jobs and provide more work to existing contractors, demonstrating that a green future can benefit you, our environment, and the economy.
