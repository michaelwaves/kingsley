The Archaeological Master Plan was adopted by Council on May 18, 2010. The Plan includes operational planning policies, guidelines, and provisions for implementation. The documentation of sites in the Archaeological Master Plan includes maps of known archaeological sites which in the public mapping have been slightly randomly offset so as to not release the exact site locations, built heritage resources, traditional land use patterns, as well as site integrity mapping. It also includes areas of non interest, which will not require an archaeological assessment ahead of being developed. The document is a key reference on all development planning decisions (including decisions related to essential public works and infrastructure renewal projects); culture and cultural tourism policies; and a consideration in the City's economic development models. Provisions concerning archaeology have also been included in the City's Official Plan (the value of archaeology is acknowledged in the Official Plans now guiding Kingston). The archaeological potential of a piece of land must now be considered as part of the planning process under the Ontario Heritage Act, the Provincial Policy Statement (2005), and the Planning Act. Recent changes to the Provincial Policy Statement, 2005 and the Ontario Heritage Act mean that archaeology needs to be addressed in planning decisions. These two documents identify archaeological resources as non renewable cultural resources necessitating municipal evaluation of planning and building applications for potential impacts to ensure their protection. Only an estimated 10 to 15 per cent of all archaeological sites in Ontario have been identified and our ability to understand and appreciate our past depends on finding and documenting such resources before they are destroyed. Kingston's archaeological heritage extends back some 11,000 years. The ground on which the city is built has hosted First Nations communities and early Canadian settlements. Our World Heritage fortifications, beautiful historic properties and vast archaeological resources are entrusted to our community, and we are responsible for understanding their value and properly cherishing them. Select a heading for further information: Archaeology is the examination and recording of human cultures in the past. Ontario's archaeological history extends back over 11,000 years. Most archaeological sites are below the ground and are not often visible. Archaeologists have developed a methodology to identify archaeological potential, including: The Archaeological Master Plan is a document that includes maps of known archaeological sites, built heritage resources, traditional land use patterns and areas of archaeological potential. It is developed specifically for a community using local information and reflecting local circumstances. Kingston's archaeological heritage extends back thousands of years and has a diverse history due to its natural resources and strategic location to rivers and Lake Ontario. Our archaeological resources are entrusted to our community, and we are responsible for understanding their value and properly managing them. The requirement to properly manage archaeological resources is established by the Ontario Heritage Act and the Provincial Policy Statement which require the proper management of archaeological resources. Municipalities are required to incorporate archaeological conservation objectives and policies for local archaeological resources and areas of archaeological potential into their official plans, land use planning documents and related development approval processes. The Archaeological Master Plan will allow the City to do all of these things. An area of Archaeological Potential is where the area's geography and history is such, that there is a reasonable possibility of archaeological resources. An Archaeologically Sensitive Area (ASA) refers to an area where there are several, known archaeological sites in the immediate vicinity and the probability of finding another site is very high. There are many areas in Kingston that are identified as having archaeological potential. The Master Plan defines areas of potential as approximately 66% of the entire City and areas of Archaeologically Sensitive Areas (ASA), such as the old City of Kingston, as well as other early settlement areas, such as Kingston Mills. If your project requires Then your proposal will be reviewed by City staff to see if it has the potential to impact archaeological resources. If your property is in an Area of Potential or in an ASA, you may be required to obtain an archaeological assessment of your property as a condition of the planning approval or in support of your application or permit. Special requirements are in place for lands located in Archaeologically Sensitive Areas (ASAs). Early consultation with the City will allow you to incorporate this possibility in your project planning. Stage 1  Background Research  The archaeologist assesses the geography and history of a parcel of land. In this process certain aspects of a site, such as nearness to water or a historical body of water, known natural resources, historic use or known nearby archaeological sites, identifies an area as having archaeological potential. At this stage, it may be determined that a property that has been significantly disturbed from previous land use activities to contain archaeological resources. A Stage 1 also determines whether further assessment is necessary. Stage 2  Field Assessment  This stage consists of an on site field survey to identify, confirm and document any archaeological site that may be present on the property. This may be achieved by pre plowing an empty field and/or test pit digging  the archaeological consultant will recommend the best method for your property. Stage 3  If an archaeological site or sites are identified on a property, a Stage 3 assessment is done to determine the nature and approximate area of the site. This may involve a surface collection of artifacts as well as exploratory excavations. Stage 4  Excavation is done on a metre by metre basis. During this stage, a site may be completely or partially excavated and a full site report will be generated to include artifact and soil analysis and an interpretation of the findings. No. They are required of public and private property owners as well. Archaeological assessments are an integral part of the environmental and planning process. In accordance with the Ontario Heritage Act, an archaeological assessment can only be done by individuals who hold a valid archaeological license. For a list of practicing archaeologists in Ontario, please see the website of the Association of Professional Archaeologists of Ontario Archaeologists bid on jobs like any other consulting firm. Costs will depend on the size of the property and the level of assessment required. The time required will depend on the scale of review required. Some field survey methods can only be done at certain times of the year. For that reason developers and property owners should consult with the Planning & Development Department and an archaeological consultant as early in the development/planning process as possible. Once the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport is satisfied that the property has been mitigated by either protecting resource in situ or documentation (i.e. excavation), and copies of the assessment and Ministry letter are filed with the City, there are no further archaeological constraints on development.

Kingston Fire & Rescue\u2019s response area covers 450 square kilometres and is divided into four geographic areas known as fire districts. Each district has fire stations that are situated to protect rural and urban areas. Rural areas have no municipally provided pressurized water source from fire hydrants versus urban areas which have a municipal source of supply. There are ten fire stations situated across four fire districts, further divided into 185 smaller geographic planning zones. Community risks (CRA) are assessed and categorized as low, moderate, high, and maximum for each zone. Kingston Fire & Rescue provides call taking and dispatching services to all fire departments in the County of Frontenac and Lennox and Addington. Kingston Fire & Rescue is the coordinating agency for Mutual Aid responses in the County of Frontenac and County of Lennox & Addington.

The strategy applies to all building permits applied for after August 31, 2019. Please note that the radon mitigation strategy does not contain provisions for existing buildings. The Ontario Building Code regulates new construction only and does not contain retrofit requirements for radon gas. As a result, the strategy is only able to address radon gas mitigation in new construction. Owners of existing buildings should contact KFL&A Public Health, Health Canada or Tarion to learn more about the health effects of radon gas, or to learn more about their options for radon gas testing and mitigation. Radon is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas that is formed naturally by the radioactive breakdown of uranium contained in soil and rock. Radon usually escapes from the ground into the air where it mixes with fresh air resulting in concentrations too low to be of concern. However, when radon enters an enclosed space through cracks and holes in floors and foundations in a building, it can accumulate to higher concentrations. Canada's radon guideline is currently 200 becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m3), and Health Canada guidelines recommend that radon gas concentrations above 200 Bq/m3 be reduced. Recent results from residential radon testing completed by KFL&A Public Health released August 12, 2019 indicate 15.7 per cent of the 615 tested homes within the City of Kingston exceed Canada's recommended guideline for radon gas of 200 Bq/m3. All radon gas testing will consist of long term tests (minimum 91 days) completed during the winter season, between October and April, when windows and doors are generally closed, and are recommended by Health Canada to be carried out by a Canadian National Radon Proficiency Program (C NRPP) certified professional. To test your home, you will need to purchase a testing device and place it in your basement or lowest occupied floor level the first winter after occupancy or later. KFL&A will be selling low cost radon tests in November 2019. Once the testing period is over, tests can be dropped off at KFL&A Public Health or sent directly to the laboratory. You should then receive your test results approximately 6 to 8 weeks from when it was sent in. As part of the Radon Gas Mitigation Strategy, all new construction and additions to low rise residential dwellings will require soil gas control measures in compliance with 9.13.4., and SB 9 of the Ontario Building Code. Depending on the soil gas control option chosen by the builder, the building may be subject to mandatory or voluntary radon gas testing requirements. Although all new homes are not subject to mandatory testing, Health Canada recommends that all buildings be tested for radon gas. If the builder chooses Option 1, the builder or their representative should point out the radon gas pipe on your pre delivery inspection (PDI). It will be a white pipe sticking out of the foundation labelled \"soil gas pipe\", to differentiate it from a bathroom waste pipe. You should ask your representative to explain how radon testing works before the PDI is over. It is the owner's responsibility to have the mandatory radon test conducted and submit the results to the City of Kingston at buildingpermits@cityofkingston.ca. If your mandatory test comes back above 200 Bq/m3, then the builder will be responsible for remediation work. Generally, this will include extending the radon pipe in your basement up through the house and venting it through the exterior with a fan. Every home and situation is different, so remediation work may vary. If the results come back below 200 Bq/m3, you have the option of whether or not you choose to remediate. If the builder chooses Options 2 or 3, where voluntary testing results come back over 200 Bq/m3, the owner should contact their builder and Tarion Home Warranty to determine next steps. Generally, the remedial measures will include breaking the concrete and adding a pipe that vents radon gas out of the building. Price and type of remediation differs for every home. Again, if the results come back below 200 Bq/m3, you have the option of whether or not you choose to mitigate. When building a home you can also request the builder select a different option if you would prefer. The builder probably needs to know before permits are applied for as the rough in will be completed around the time the foundation is poured. Where mandatory radon gas testing results come back over 200 Bq/m3, the building owner will be responsible for remediation work. All new homes in Ontario come with a new home warranty that is provided by your builder and backed by Tarion. This warranty also covers excessive radon gas levels in new homes for seven years from the date of occupancy.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/emergency-services": "The City and/or KFL&A Public Health have plans to help or advise residents dealing with foreseeable emergencies.

The purpose of the review was to update the City's commercial inventory, complete a commercial land supply and demand analysis, and provide guidance and policy recommendations to update and improve the commercial policy structure in the City's Official Plan. The City retained SGL Planning and Design Inc. and urbanMetrics inc. to complete the review. The key findings and recommendations of the Commercial Land Review are: Provincial policy has resulted in increased residential intensification, which in turn has led to more intensive commercial formats that had previously been resisted by the retail industry. In 2015, the city currently had approximately 9.6 million square feet of commercial space in total. It is estimated that almost 1 million square feet of commercial space has been added since 2007. The downtown commercial node comprises 15% of all commercial space in Kingston and is the city's largest commercial node. The \u2018Services' category (which includes financial services, entertainment, personal services, medical services, eating/drinking facilities, professional offices, daycare facilities and others) has experienced the highest growth between 2007 and 2015. The distribution of commercial space on a per capita basis (based on 2015 population estimates) is as follows: In 2007, the city had an overall commercial vacancy rate of 4.95% which has since increased to 6.5% city wide. Although the vacancy rate has increased, it remains within a healthy range, which is typically between 5% and 8%. Demand: by 2036, approximately 1.5 million square feet of additional retail space is warranted in Kingston. However due to the forecasted decline in population after 2036, the warranted additional new space is anticipated to decline to 1.3 million square feet by 2041. Supply: the updated vacant commercial land inventory as of March 12, 2015 totals 76.7 hectares. The supply and demand analysis has identified the potential over supply of commercial space of approximately 955,800 square feet by 2041. The findings indicate that there is no demonstrated need for additional commercial designated lands in the city. While there may be needed uses that may not be able to fit on an existing commercial site, the City should ensure that Market findings support residential development downtown to support downtown commercial vitality, and continued encouragement of mixed use formats. The review offers recommendations pertaining to potential Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw amendments. The review suggests that existing policies in the Official Plan adequately express Council's support and commitment to creating a sustainable, healthy, and vibrant community, and its encouragement for mixed land use development. Some amendments are proposed to the existing commercial policies that will more clearly express the strategic policy direction to further prevent the over supply of commercial designated lands, to support and encourage the creation of mixed use areas where appropriate, and to encourage the provision of more walkable commercial areas that foster a sense of place. The recommendations for the Zoning Bylaw are intended to ensure alignment of the range of permitted uses with the intent of the land use designations and also to improve streetscapes and the pedestrian environment (for example, reduced front yard setbacks, and minimum landscaped open spaces). The recommendations of the review will be implemented through an Official Plan amendment, distinct from the on going Official Plan Update, and new zoning standards will be considered in the Comprehensive Zoning Bylaw. 1211 John Counter Blvd. 8:30 a.m.  4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday By Mail: 216 Ontario Street, Kingston, Ontario, K7L 2Z3", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/business/planning-and-developmenturban-design-projects-guidelines": "The City is committed to a high standard of urban design.

When a pothole claim is received we will review to determine whether the service level standards were met. Canadian winters create potholes. When temperatures rise, water from thawed snow seeps into small cracks on roads and then expands when it freezes again causing cracks to grow. The more often we experience this freeze/thaw cycle, the more potholes form. Potholes can also form as the road surface warms in the spring and the frost is driven deeper in the ground. The road base does not thaw evenly which can result in soft or saturated spots under the asphalt surface, and more potholes.

When it's operating, the rink is open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Accessible public washrooms are available in the lower Market Wing of City Hall via the North and South courtyards. An accessibility ramp to the lower level Wing is available at the North entrance off Brock Street. Washrooms are open 7 days a week, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Change rooms are not available. Before visiting, please be sure you're familiar with the below rules: Participants are requested to: Late November/early December. It's weather dependent. Precipitation, sun and warm temperatures work against us. Ideally, we would have five dry days of grey skies at around  4 C, but we rarely get that. So we offer a date range based on historic temperature trends. The NHL game at Dodger Stadium used the largest mobile refrigeration plant in the world and two engineering teams (roughly 18 people) to make a pad of ice for that one game. It took them three weeks to make it, working only at night and covering it with a thermal shield during the day. Making and sustaining an ice pad over several months is decidedly a different task. The Square does have a refrigeration plant, however if our ice gets too thin it might crack. If it cracks we could be down for a few days while we repair. The first thing we do is lay down roughly 60 peripheral boards to define the rink's edges. Each board is numbered and needs to go in a certain spot so that it can be correctly anchored in place. Then we need to bring the surface temperature down to about  5 C. At that point we can start to make ice. We need a good 1.5 inches of ice before anyone can skate on the rink and, ideally, we have somewhere between 2.5 and 3 inches of ice. Certain conditions can cause us to start losing the thickness of the ice (sun, warm temperatures and precipitation) \u2013 and if it gets too thin it risks cracking. Our arena operators monitor the situation and drill to confirm the ice's depth and hardness. If it makes sense to close the rink down for four hours, they will do that rather than risk having to close it for three days. Not really. It's based on the weather. In 2015, for example, we were open for 110 skating days out of a possible 113. We are blessed with some great ice making professionals and that really helps. The rest is up to Mother Nature. The City's outdoor rink policy states that all City operated outdoor rinks are to close at 9 p.m. The exception is Springer Market Square, which closes at 10 p.m. (before the Noise Bylaw comes into effect at 11 p.m.) This allows staff to complete the work necessary to get the rink ready for skating the next day, such as Zamboni work or other ice maintenance as required. When the ice becomes difficult to maintain due to warm daytime temperatures and melting, the City will decide to close it for the season. We turn off the refrigeration plant, so the pad returns to its ambient temperature. The ice will melt (depending on weather conditions). We then use the ice resurfacer to start shaving down the thickness of the ice. We can only do this to a certain depth, as we don't want to risk the blade damaging the pavers underneath (or the ice resurfacer itself). We locate the drains and unplug them (we plug them to keep the water in to flood at the start of the ice season), this allows the melted water to drain out which speeds things up. The time it takes to close the rink depends on the weather.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/explore/springer-market-square/webcam": "Webcam located on the roof of the British Whig Building looking over King Street, Springer Market Square and City Hall.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/transit/service-alerts/-/asset_publisher/3OOFJ6cPLiji/content/2022-09-12-tsa-via?_com_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_3OOFJ6cPLiji_assetEntryId=39718964&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cityofkingston.ca%2Fresidents%2Ftransit%2Fservice-alerts%3Fp_p_id%3Dcom_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_3OOFJ6cPLiji%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview": "2022 09 12  TSA  VIA Effective Monday, September 12, Route 18 Train Station buses will not service the shelter on John Counter at Old Mill.

According to the 2010 Health Canada Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality,7 the maximum acceptable concentration of fluoride in drinking water is 1.5 ppm (parts per million or mg/L), while the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water is 0.7 ppm. Municipalities with fluoridated drinking water adjust fluoride levels to fall within this Health Canada range, as well as within their own provincial or territorial guidelines.\" Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health The majority of Canadians (88.9%) receive their water from municipal water supplies (from water piped into their homes), while 10.5% of Canadians get their water from private wells, and the remainder (0.6%) have their water hauled in (e.g., water trucked into the community). CWF is only available to Canadians who drink from municipal water supplies and, as of 2017, roughly 39% of Canadians have access to fluoridated water. However, in 2007, this estimate was 45% of the population. This decrease is most likely the result of several large Canadian cities having discontinued water fluoridation. Under the Fluoridation Act of Ontario, the council of a municipality may enact a bylaw to establish, maintain and operate a fluoridation system in connection with the waterworks system. Decisions regarding CWF programs are complex, with many stakeholders and issues to consider. While most public health and oral health organizations, and about 60% of the Canadian public, view CWF as an effective, safe, and equitable means of improving and protecting the oral health of populations, CWF is a controversial topic, with strong feelings both in favour of and against water fluoridation. Additionally, implementing CWF programs requires a multi level process, with involvement and different roles and responsibilities from all levels of government. Regulators are often different from those who decide whether CWF programs will be started (or stopped), who in turn are often different from those who pay for oral health care.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/community-services/fr/housing": "Le Centre d'enregistrement pour les logements sociaux et les Services aux sans abri sont deux programmes mis sur pied par la Ville \u00e0 l'intention des personnes d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es.

As motorists, it\u2019s important that we drive with care in our neighbourhoods and school areas, respect parking regulations, and remain ready to stop at all times. Together, we can ensure safe journeys to and from school for all. Many families live within a short walk, roll, or bike ride to school. Choosing active travel to school has many benefits, including: Families that live within the school bus catchment area are encouraged to have their children ride the bus to school. Riding the bus helps to reduce vehicle congestion in the school area, improves road safety for students walking and cycling to school, and minimizes our collective environmental impact. Alternatively, students aged 14 years old can ride Kingston Transit for free. Grade 9 12 students are also eligible for a free Student Pass for unlimited use of Kingston Transit. For families that need to drive to school, consider parking a block or two from the school and walking or rolling the last few minutes to complete your journey. After school, meet your child at the entrance and walk or roll back to your vehicle together. Even a few minutes of active travel can have a big impact on student health and mental preparedness for classroom learning, while limiting traffic and improving student safety in the school area. The City\u2019s parking regulations in school areas are in place to improve road safety for all users. Illegally parked vehicles create safety hazards by impeding sightlines, school buses, transit, and other essential services. Ensuring your vehicle is stopped or parked legally for student pick up and drop off is essential for the safety of students and other road users. You can stop briefly to drop off or pick up students in this area, but you cannot park and wait in your vehicle. You cannot stop to drop off or pick up students in this area for any length of time. \u2018No Stopping\u2019 restrictions are typically in effect: Double parking is illegal and creates sightline issues for vehicles attempting to pass and for pedestrians crossing the street. Speeding is illegal and dangerous. Travelling at higher speeds results in a longer stopping distance and increases the potential for conflicts with pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. In areas designated as Community Safety Zones, the fines for many traffic violations, including speeding, are doubled to promote safer driving Make sure the intersection is clear before proceeding through stop signs, school crossings, and pedestrian crossings.

The City may use these guidelines for specific types of development, for specific areas of the City, or for the entire City. The residential design guidelines are separated into the following: The guidelines do the following: They guidelines are designed to assist applicants in preparing plans, and staff, committees and the public in assessing proposals. They apply to residential development within the urban area of the City of Kingston. The revised design guidelines are formatted to make the City's design objectives user friendly and accessible. The key part of each guideline is in bold so readers can quickly scan the document to check for relevant policies. A checklist in the document also provides a quick summary of design objectives. Applicants are expected to review their development proposal against the guidelines. Where relevant guidelines are not met, applicants should be prepared to explain why this is the case. While the guidelines are not regulations, they are meant to give guidance and to allow flexible design responses. The guidelines are not intended to take precedence in all situations. They are supplemental when a more area specific set of guidelines is in force (e.g. Heritage Conservation District, Secondary Plan Area, etc.). The guidelines have been created in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders, including the public, the development community and industry professionals such as planners, architects and engineers. They were approved by Council in October 2015. Links to various urban design guidelines are below and other related links of interest are to the right.

The Administrative Policies Committee recommended as follows: That Council approve the phase out of the current Vacant Unit Rebate program over a two year period such that for the 2018 taxation year (applications due by Feb. 28, 2019), the existing vacant unit rebate will continue to be available, for the 2019 taxation year (applications due by March 2, 2020) the rebate rate will be reduced to 15 per cent for commercial and 17.5 per cent for industrial vacant units, and for the 2020 taxation year (applications due by March 1, 2021) the rebate will be fully eliminated. This recommendation was approved by Council at the July 9, 2019 City Council meeting. The Ministry of Finance has now passed O. Reg. 385/19 amending O. Reg. 325/01 under the Municipal Act, 2001 implementing the requested changes to the Vacant Unit Rebate program. Similar to other Ontario municipalities, in 2018, the City began to consider changes to its Vacancy Tax Rebate and Reduction Programs to better encourage the use of vacant properties in support of vibrant and sustainable communities. Residents, businesses and property owners were invited to learn more about proposed changes by: On June 13, 2019, City staff presented the Vacant Unit Rebate and Subclass Reduction Programs Report to the administrative policies committee (see above). This recommendation was approved by council at the July 9, 2019 City Council meeting. City staff submitted a formal request to the province's Ministry of Finance to issue a regulation to proceed with implementing the changes. The vacant unit rebate and subclass reduction programs provide tax rebates or reductions to property owners who have eligible vacancies in commercial and industrial buildings or land. Eligible properties receive a rebate or reduction of 30 per cent (for vacant commercial space or land) or 35 per cent (for vacant industrial space or land). The Province has also been reviewing approaches related to the education property tax portion of the vacancy rebate and reduction programs. An excerpt from 2018 Ontario Budget (e p. 321) states: \"In the 2016 Budget, the Province introduced a legislative framework to give municipalities broad flexibility to refine their vacancy rebate and reduction programs. This greater flexibility enables municipalities to tailor these programs to best reflect local circumstances, while considering the interests of local businesses. While municipalities that decided to modify their vacancy programs have implemented a variety of changes, 80 per cent of those municipalities will phase out the municipal component by 2020. \"With respect to education property taxes, the Province currently mirrors any municipal property tax decisions related to the vacancy programs. This has resulted in different treatments of education property taxes across the province, as each municipality modifies the programs to best suit its local needs. As a result, the Province announced in the 2017 Ontario Economic Outlook and Fiscal Review that it would review approaches related to the education property tax portion of the vacancy rebate and reduction programs in consultation with municipalities and the business community. \"As a result of the review, the government will align the education property tax portion of these programs with the changes made by municipalities, ensuring greater consistency across the province. This initiative would begin in 2019 to ensure that businesses have time to plan for any necessary program changes.\" Each year, the City receives approximately 180 applications from property owners in the commercial and industrial property classes requesting compensation for vacancies of 90 or more consecutive days. The City's 2018 operating budget includes $950,000 for the cost of the rebate program. Options under consideration include: The vacant unit rebate program provides tax rebates to property owners who have eligible vacancies in commercial and industrial buildings. To receive a vacant unit rebate owners must apply and meet eligibility criteria before being awarded a rebate of 30 per cent (vacant commercial space) or 35 per cent (vacant industrial space). Owners of commercial or industrial assessed property that are entirely or partially vacant are eligible to apply and benefit from the rebate. Seasonal and leased properties are not eligible for the rebate. Though residential and multi residential property owners also experience vacancies, these properties are not eligible for the rebate. Vacant unit rebate statistics: Year Total Municipal Portion of Rebate Total Education Portion of Rebate Number of Properties 2011 465,814 320,628 174 2012 468,294 333,770 161 2013 657,819 406,094 173 2014 667,394 401,893 195 2015 944,444 584,182 208 2016 930,603 583,334 187 2017 759,249 465,412 175 The vacant unit rebate program was originally implemented to address the Province's decision to move the business occupancy tax liability from business tenants to property owners in 1998. In 2001, it became mandatory for municipalities to provide a vacant unit tax rebate program. As of Jan. 1, 2017 the vacant unit rebate program is no longer a mandatory requirement. The City's 2018 operating budget includes an estimate of $950,000 to fund the vacant unit rebate program. The program is funded as part of the overall tax levy and is subsidized by all property classes, including residential property owners. The additional education tax component of the rebate, funded by the Province, results in a total projected rebate of $1,550,000 provided annually to commercial and industrial property owners. The Province also allows for potential changes to the Vacant/Excess Land Property Tax Subclass Reductions. Commercial and industrial properties or portions of these properties can be assessed in a Vacant and Excess Land Property Tax Subclass. Taxable assessment included in these subclasses is taxed at a fixed percentage rate below the tax rate of the broader class. These properties are discounted at 30 per cent of the full Commercial rate and 35 per cent of the full Industrial rate. In response to municipal and stakeholder requests, the Province is allowing municipalities to propose changes to their Vacant Unit Rebate Program and Vacant and Excess Land Subclass Reductions. This allows municipalities to tailor the rebate and reduction programs to local needs after engaging with the local business community and taxpayers as a whole. Council has directed City staff to begin a consultation process with the general public, including the business community in order to gather input and feedback on available options and their impacts. Note: The suggested possible program changes are not comprehensive and should not be taken as the only changes or plans the municipality could consider. Here are some things to consider: Several options have been proposed: Note: The suggested possible program changes are not comprehensive and should not be taken as the only changes or plans the municipality could consider.

This newly launched program is one of many initiatives the City has launched to support collective climate action in the community. Climate change is an issue that affects us all. When we developed the Climate Leadership Plan, we created a road map that would bring us to carbon neutrality by 2040. But to achieve our ambitious targets, we need active participation from everyone in our community. Programs like the Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions are a new way we can help achieve collective action, with champions working directly with their neighbours to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). I am excited by the passionate champions who have volunteered to work with and to inspire their neighbours. I\u2019m amazed by the innovative and unique ideas each champion is bringing forward, and seeing this commitment to climate action, I\u2019m proud to be a member of the Kingston community. In my role as the Manager, Climate Leadership, I have the pleasure of working with staff and the community to implement the ambitious targets identified in the Climate Leadership Plan. Each target was developed with the help of the Kingston community through an in depth consultation process that led to actionable opportunities for reductions in GHG emissions. The Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions will support these GHG emission reductions, acting as one piece of the larger puzzle that will bring us closer to our goal. While the Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions program is just getting started, I\u2019m pleased to share the success of another climate action program that launched in April 2022. Better Homes Kingston is an initiative designed to help Kingston residents make their homes more energy efficient and climate friendly. With residential energy use accounting for an estimated 19% of community GHG emissions, home retrofits are a critical component of climate action initiatives. This program helps homeowners undertake those deep energy retrofits with the help of zero interest loans that can be applied to energy improvements. We began accepting applications in April and we are thrilled by the extraordinary response! This program was intended to run for four years, yet within the first six months of launching, we surpassed our four year target. While that means we have temporarily paused application intake, we invite interested residents to join the program waitlist. The success of Better Homes Kingston truly highlights the passion and commitment to climate action in our community. It gives me great joy to share this achievement and I have no doubt that this milestone is one of many good news stories we\u2019ll be able to share in the coming months. We have come a long way since the City declared a climate emergency in March 2019. Work continues on the ground, led by your neighbours, schools, clubs and workplaces. The City is working hard to change how we operate, reducing our own carbon footprint today and planning for the future. We are making progress, but there is still much work to be done. Through this blog, I hope to bring you updates on our work implementing the Climate Leadership Plan. I plan to share the achievements of our passionate community who are advancing this work individually, as part of community groups and associations, and through programs like the Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions. We must continue to work together to make a difference, and seeing the passion and progress from our community, I am confident we will meet our goal of carbon neutrality by 2040. I will also bring you in depth stories on the climate issues facing our community and how we are working to mitigate, adapt and work together for change.

This was commonly referred to as density bonusing. To take advantage of Section 37 of the Planning Act, municipalities were required to have enabling policies in their Official Plan. Accordingly, the City's Official Plan contains these policies in sections 9.5.25 to 9.5.30. The City has used the enabling policies multiple times. Through Bill 108, More Homes, More Choice Act, 2019 and Bill 197, COVID 19 Economic Recovery Act, 2020, the Province made amendments to Section 37 of the Planning Act, replacing the density bonusing provisions set out in this Section with a new Community Benefits Charge (CBC). A CBC is a new growth funding tool that allows municipalities, by bylaw, to levy a charge against new development that is at least five storeys in height and with at least ten residential units, with limited exceptions. The new Section 37 provisions came into effect on Sept. 18, 2020; however, the density bonusing provisions of Section 37 of the Planning Act will remain in effect until Sept. 18, 2022, or until the municipality enacts a CBC By Law, whichever is earlier. After Sept. 18, 2022, the City will no longer be able to negotiate a Section 37 agreement using the density bonusing provisions, however any existing agreements will remain in effect. To set a community benefits charge, the City must development a CBC Strategy that identifies the facilities, services, and matters that will be funded through CBCs and pass a CBC bylaw. In Spring 2022, the City retained Watson & Associates Economists Ltd. to prepare a CBC Strategy for the City pursuant to the requirements of the Planning Act.

Additionally, as part of Ontario\u2019s More Homes, More Choice: Ontario\u2019s Housing Supply Action Plan, the Province appointed a Housing Affordability Task Force in December 2021. CBC News and TVO have recently covered this, noting that a report from the Task Force with recommendations on speeding up the development approvals process and measures to increase the supply of market housing is anticipated to be released on Jan. 31. These recommendations may lead to further changes to the Planning Act. Municipalities have been provided an opportunity to provide feedback on opportunities that exist to help address the housing crisis looking at policy, legislation and process. Staff are following media closely and are receiving information from Ministry partners and are eagerly awaiting the release of that report. Staff will review the Task Force recommendations comprehensively with the Bill 13 changes and will bring a report to Council for consideration of options once more information is known. In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. Planning staff are happy to walk residents through some of these changes.

(The almost in this case refers to a limited number of properties that have old permissions under the former zoning by laws). While Council approved the new Kingston Zoning By law Number 2022 62 (ZBL 22 62) at a special meeting on April 26, two appeals were submitted to the Ontario Land Tribunal, which held up the entire by law. At a settlement hearing on September 28, the Ontario Land Tribunal issued an oral decision confirming that the vast majority of the by law is in effect (all portions that are not under appeal). In harmonizing, simplifying, and modernizing the zoning provisions, ZBL 22 62 supports new economic development through simplified and flexible definitions that encourage new industries and business innovations to thrive across the city. Home occupation permissions allow for flexible business opportunities while still ensuring that residential neighbourhoods maintain their planned function. New complementary use permissions have been added for places of worship and new rules support schools, recognizing the importance of these community facilities in our neighbourhoods. ZBL 22 62 supports a more vibrant, healthy, and diversified rural area by protecting our most important agricultural resources while expanding the range of agricultural uses and allowing for new agri tourism uses. It supports on farm diversified uses and agriculture related uses, and focuses rural growth to the hamlets. It also introduces new permissions for \u201crural uses\u201d, seasonal cabins and bunkhouses, providing new opportunities and ways for our residents and tourists to our area to enjoy rural lands. Residential permissions of ZBL 22 62 are inclusive and focused on equitable housing opportunities for all people. The rules focus on land use impacts and are intended to accommodate all residents and all housing needs in our community. New housing construction is supported by new additional residential unit permissions allowing up to 3 units on properties with a single detached house, semi detached house, or townhouse. Some vacant lands that have been planned for future subdivisions have also been \u201cpre zoned\u201d to allow for residential development, minimizing costs (which get passed on to future purchasers) and supporting the creation of as many new housing units in areas of the city that have the infrastructure available to support new housing. New co living unit permissions have been added for apartment and mixed use buildings, creating opportunities for a new form of affordable housing. Through the work of the Central Kingston Growth Strategy, two areas for intensification were \u201cup zoned\u201d to accommodate much of the anticipated growth within Central Kingston in areas that are well located relative to commercial, employment, transportation and recreation opportunities. A \u2018made in Kingston\u2019 solution transformed the parking approach in ZBL 22 62 by eliminating minimum parking requirements for non residential uses and reducing minimum parking requirements for residential uses. The By law supports alternative transportation options such as car share, active transportation, and public transit through innovative and interconnected zoning provisions. The new approach continues to require essential accessible parking, and strategically supports the creation of affordable housing and the conservation of built heritage resources. For the first time, the parking approach connects directly to broader, strategic objectives such as demonstrating leadership on climate action, broadly supporting housing affordability and encouraging desirable built form in the public realm. To complement the progress in the ZBL 22 62, a new Cash in Lieu of Parking By Law will support the establishment of a city wide car sharing program where fees will support the implementation and operation of car sharing services in the City. Last, but certainly not least, ZBL 22 62 protects built heritage resources, major infrastructure, the natural heritage system and source water and helps to protects people and buildings from natural and human made hazards. We are proud of the work we have done as a community to bring this new zoning by law to fruition and look forward to seeing the many ways that it will support the future growth of our City.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/resident/homelessness-services": "The City is the Service Manager, responsible for administering Community Homelessness Prevention Initiative (CHPI) funding in Kingston and the County of Frontenac.

All locations have staff who can coordinate referrals to a variety of supports, including housing services and more. The City Encampment Protocol/Procedure is intended to guide staff and partners in providing outreach services to homeless individuals camping outside in public spaces by providing individuals with access to alternative solutions prior to the enforcement of City bylaws, which may lead to the displacement of individuals and the removal of their belongings. The intent is for the City and its partners to assist people camping in public spaces to access safer and healthier alternatives to living outside, including housing, support services and shelter. The protocol also provides a balance between the provision of supports to vulnerable populations camping in public spaces with the City\u2019s desire to maintain intended access and use of public spaces. The objective of this protocol is to establish a clear process for City departments and partners that focuses on a proactive and supportive approach to help vulnerable individuals camping in public spaces relocate to alternative service options prior to any enforcement activities related to public spaces (e.g., such as the removal of unauthorized structures, personal goods and debris). It is always the objective of City staff and its\u2019 partners\u2019 to assist individuals in voluntarily vacating public spaces and securing improved alternatives to sleeping outside, making enforcement unnecessary. In order to be successful and truly support individuals in need, assessments must be performed on a case by case basis, as the needs of individuals camping in public spaces will vary greatly. These procedures will be executed when dealing with one or a few tents/structures that have appeared in public spaces that is not a designated camping location and on private properties. 540 Montreal St. Kingston Homebase Website 661 Montreal St. HARS Website 115 Barrack St. Street Health Centre website", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/recreation/facilities/arenas": "The City offers several ice sport programs including Little Blades, shinny, and public skating opportunities on 19 ice and shooter pads in seven different facilities.

Anyone wishing to remove a tree must find out whether a tree permit is required. Revisions to the bylaw include the following: Generally, the Tree Bylaw does not apply to residential properties, however property owners should ensure that the tree they wish to remove is not located within the municipal right of way on their property and that it is not protected as part of a Tree Preservation and Protection Plan. To determine whether the tree you wish to remove is within the municipal right of way, please contact the customer service centre at 613 546 0000. To obtain further information about the Tree Bylaw or to inquire if a tree permit is required for a particular situation, please contact the planning department at 613 546 4291, ext. 3180. More information regarding the Tree Bylaw, including requirements for a permit and exemptions to the bylaw: * Tree Permit applications are now submitted via DASH A tree permit is required for the removal of the following trees: Also, the following sub sections describe who and what the Tree Bylaw applies to, and when a Tree Permit is required in order to remove a tree. New Development  Planning Approvals Required New development that requires Planning Approvals (e.g. Plan of Subdivision, Plan of Condominium, Site Plan Control, or Severance) is required to address the issue of tree removal and replacement as part of their Planning Application(s). If tree removal is to occur before Planning Approvals have been received, a separate Tree Permit is required. Commercial Harvesting A Tree Permit is required for the harvesting of trees on property that is greater than one hectare in area, unless a Forest Management Plan has been prepared by a Registered Professional Forester and submitted to and accepted by the Director of Planning & Development. The following sub sections describe who and what is exempt from the Tree Bylaw, and when a Tree Permit is not required in order to remove a tree. A Tree Permit is not required in order to prune a tree, as long as the pruning is done in a manner that does not harm the tree. Individuals that are uncertain as to how to properly prune a tree without harming it should contact a Certified Arborist (certified by the International Society of Arboriculture  ISA) by referring to the yellow pages of the telephone book under \"Tree Service\". The ISA also offers information about pruning on their website at www.treesaregood.com Also, a Tree Permit is not required in order to remove trees that are dead, severely damaged or diseased, or that pose a danger to people or buildings. However, a letter of proof from a Certified Arborist must be submitted to the Director of Planning & Development for approval before a tree can be removed for health or hazard reasons. The Tree Bylaw does not apply to residential properties, and a Tree Permit is not required in order to remove a tree. However, please ensure that the subject tree is located entirely on private property. Trees located within road rights of way are Municipal Trees; all maintenance and/or removal of such trees are the responsibility of the City of Kingston. The removal of a Municipal Tree is a chargeable offense under the Tree Bylaw. Trees that cross property lines, and the pruning of branches that overhang onto neighbouring properties, are civil issues between neighbours and are not addressed by the Tree Bylaw. New construction of buildings that do not require Planning Approvals also do not require a Tree Permit, as long as a Building Permit has been obtained, and as long as the trees that are removed are no more than 15 metres from the location of the proposed building. A Tree Permit is also not required for the installation of a driveway, or public or private utilities. The following are other exemptions to the Tree Bylaw where a Tree Permit is not required: Any person wishing to remove a tree should check with the appropriate municipal staff to determine whether a Tree Permit is required. Contact the Planning and Development Department at 613 546 4291, ext. 3180. If a Tree Permit is required, an applicant should do the following: Depending upon the situation, an Arborist Report may be required in support of a Tree Permit Application. The Arborist's Report is expected to address the reasons for the proposed removal of the tree(s) and the preservation measures to be taken for any trees to be retained. If an Arborist Report is required, the Applicant will need to have the report prepared by a Qualified Forestry Consultant, which includes: Replacement trees may be required as a condition to a Tree Permit. Although it is recognized that trees will have to be removed for both natural causes (i.e. disease) and to allow for development or redevelopment, the long term goal is to at least maintain, if not increase, the amount of tree coverage in the City. Sections 9 and 10 of the Tree Bylaw deal with the issues of compensation and replacement trees. In most instances, tree replacement can be considered as a condition of a Tree Permit, where, for uncomplicated proposals, the replacement of trees can be realized on a ratio of one replacement tree for every tree removed. However, the City does encourage replacement ratios greater than one to one, in order to increase tree coverage and its related benefits. In the event that the tree to be removed is located on Municipal Property, or is removed without a Tree Permit, the value of the tree, and the number of replacement trees required, will be calculated using the Trunk Formula Method of the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA), as illustrated in Schedule 'C' to the Tree Bylaw. The ISA formula takes into consideration a variety of factors to determine the value of a tree, including size, age, species, health, and location. The value of some trees can be considerable, and will therefore usually result in a ratio for replacement trees greater than one to one. Any monies received in lieu of replacement trees shall be used for the purpose of reforestation. A person that has applied for a Tree Permit may appeal to the Council of the City of Kingston under the following situations: If someone is convicted of an offence for contravening the Tree Bylaw, the conditions of a Tree Permit, or an Order, the Court may order any or all of the following penalties: You may also contact the Planning & Development Department to obtain further information and to inquire if a Tree Permit is required for a particular situation.

By helping house our prospective tenants, you are playing an integral role not only in helping individuals take charge of their lives, but also in making your community a better place to live. Together we can make a difference in our community! The City of Kingston & County of Frontenac's 10 Year Housing & Homelessness Plan aims to end chronic homelessness by 2023. The plan proposes a new approach to housing and services called Housing First that delivers a framework to offer more intensive supports. The housing first approach provides access to permanent housing with supports that help individuals obtain and retain housing. This approach has been shown to enhance social inclusion, community integration and self sufficiency among individuals and families who are homeless. The City, through the plan, has developed objectives and targets related to housing and homelessness, as well as specific actions to achieve those objectives. This will help form the City's priorities over the next years. One priority is to provide an integrated system of housing and supports that ends chronic homelessness. In 2011, the new Housing Services Act came into effect, requiring all Service Managers in Ontario to develop a ten year plan by December 31, 2013. The City of Kingston is the service manager for Kingston and the County of Frontenac. The City hired a consulting firm who had international experience in homelessness. Throughout 2012 and 2013, the City, with the assistance of consultants and community service providers, developed the priorities and strategies to address homelessness. At the same time the Municipal Housing Strategy, approved by Council in 2011, was updated. The Plan envisions that the evidence informed changes it is making to the homeless services system (e.g., coordinated services and planning amongst service providers, increased housing with individualized supports to stabilize people in housing, sharing of data, and data informed program and system improvements) by the year 2023, will result in: Housing First is both an approach and a housing program designed to end homelessness. It is a recovery oriented approach to homelessness that involves moving people who experience homelessness into independent and permanent housing as quickly as possible, with no pre conditions, and then providing them with the right intensity of housing case management supports to help them stabilize and maintain their housing; preventing them from returning to homelessness. Individuals and families will be able to go to one of several access locations where the process to address their needs begins immediately. They will no longer have to \"figure it out\" on their own. Those who are chronically homeless will be able to get the intensive housing supports they need to obtain and maintain housing. Their cycle of repeated episodes of homelessness will end. The changes to end chronic homelessness begin in January 2015. Over the last 4 months, the City with its community partners have been working hard to ensure the transition is smooth and the staff delivering the services have the training they need to be successful. The City will prepare key messages that each agency will include in their informational material, be it brochures, websites or public engagements. The agencies are critical in the implementation as they are the providers of the programs and services. Agency responsibilities are detailed in service agreements with the City. In addition, the City in collaboration with the service providers, have developed Program Operating Policies which set the standard for services across the system. The City has provided additional funding to support the transition and ensure agencies can have staff in place and ready to provide high quality services. The City has and will continue to organize and fund training events for agencies at the leadership and staff levels. Working groups have been organized by the City in each of the Program areas and together agencies and City staff have further developed the service delivery policies. As the housing first system changes are implemented there will be less need for emergency shelter because the most chronic users of emergency shelter with the greatest barriers to housing will move into housing and be provided individualized housing supports. There is a phased approach to reducing shelter beds in the community which will continue as the system matures. The new system will shift investment from managing clients' needs while in shelters and while homeless to moving them into housing and providing supports. The new system will reduce the number of people who enter homelessness through increased investment in homelessness prevention and diversion to \"natural\" alternatives to shelter such as staying with friends and family members. Chronic shelter users and those with the highest needs will be moved into permanent housing with intensive supports, thereby reducing the need for emergency shelter beds. However, there will always be people who will need to use emergency shelters. More resources will be directed to providing shelter users with increased assistance in exiting emergency shelters which will reduce their stays, and reduce the need for as many shelter beds in Kingston.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/get-involved": "Check out Get Involved Kingston our online engagement site to share, participate & engage.

The Plan recognizes that the City is made up of a wide variety of urban, suburban, agricultural and rural land uses as well as a number of defining environmental features. It serves as the blueprint for how the City will grow over the next 20 years and will assist in making Kingston Canada's most sustainable city. The Official Plan also provides a framework for establishing the City\u2019s zoning bylaw to set local regulations and standards, for example, those related to how land or buildings are used, where buildings can be located, the height of buildings, etc. The Official Plan for the City of Kingston came into effect on January 27, 2010. Official Plan Amendment Number 50, being the five year update of the Official Plan, came into effect on August 29, 2017.

The Planning Act requires that municipalities in Ontario adopt an Official Plan that is consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement. It is intended to guide development in Kingston until 2036, but will be reviewed every five years in accordance with the requirements of the Planning Act and may be amended by the City to reflect changing circumstances or new priorities for resource protection, growth or redevelopment. The Official Plan consists of both written policy and attached maps. It is organized into 10 main sections. The Plan is organized to move from fundamental and broadly based planning principles, and strategic policy approaches of the City to the more specific land use policies, resource and utility policies, implementation tools, and then to secondary plans and specific policy areas, which are more detailed provisions for specific geographic areas of the City. The Official Plan is the main tool for ensuring that future development and redevelopment are properly managed and directed to appropriate locations within the municipality. Without an Official Plan, the municipality could experience haphazard development, resulting in higher service costs and increased property taxes. In addition, many day to day problems would result from conflicting land uses that could create unacceptable living and working conditions. Yes, the Official Plan affects every City of Kingston resident. The Plan determines where new houses, stores, industries, schools, parks, and other land uses will be built; protects our natural environment; and directs the construction of new services such as sewers, watermains and roads. Sometimes due to new conditions in the community or a proposed development, an Official Plan may need to be changed or 'amended'. An Official Plan amendment is a Bylaw passed by City Council. An amendment may seek to change the land use designation of a property and/or apply new policies to that property as part of a proposed development or expansion to an existing use that is not allowed under the existing Official Plan. An Official Plan amendment may also require other approvals before the development can take place such as a Zoning Bylaw amendment. Although Official Plans must be approved by the Provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, City Council has been granted authority to approve Official Plan amendments. With Official Plan amendments, the applicant must be able to show City Council that the proposed development meets the City's long term plans for the area and is compatible with surrounding land uses. The process for amending an Official Plan is made up of the following 11 steps: You should discuss your plans with City planning staff before you submit the application. A planner will: The planner may also suggest that other city departments such as the engineering department and/or Utilities Kingston be consulted before you submit the application to determine if there are any development issues or concerns. After you have consulted with city staff, you will need to submit the following to the planning department: Applications will not be accepted if incomplete or inaccurate information is provided. Once the application has been received, you will be sent a letter advising you of the planner who will be responsible for your application. The planner will send out a notice to interested parties requesting to receive notification that your application has been received. The application will also be provided to other city departments and outside agencies for review and comment. Once the application review is completed, it will be considered by the planning committee, which is one of the standing committees of City Council. A public meeting report to the planning committee will be prepared by the planner. This report will include a description of the subject lands, a summary of the proposed development and an outline of the regulations and policies that relate to the application such as those in the Official Plan and the Provincial Policy Statement. Once the public meeting report has been prepared, a statutory public meeting at the planning committee needs to be scheduled to consider your application. This public meeting will also consider other development approval requirements for your application, such as Zoning Bylaw amendments, should they be required. A 'Notice of Public Meeting' will be posted on the City's website and published in the Kingston Whig Standard as well as mailed to all property owners within 120 metres of the subject lands and to other interested parties requesting to receive notification at least 20 days before the meeting date. In addition to these notices and depending on the nature of your application, you may also be required to install signage on the subject lands that notifies the public about this meeting. The planning committee typically meets on the first and third Thursday of every month. Public meetings generally start at 6:30 p.m. and are held prior to the regular meeting of the planning committee. At the public meeting, you or someone on your behalf will make a presentation describing your proposed development and the reasons for the Official Plan amendment. At this point any interested party may make written submissions to the planning committee or appear before the committee to comment on your application. Once all public input has been received, you will have an opportunity to respond to the comments. After this, the public meeting will be closed. The planner will collect all of the comments made at the public meeting and prepare a comprehensive report. This report will include an analysis of the proposed development, a discussion of the issues raised at the public meeting and a recommendation on whether your application should be approved or rejected. If the comprehensive report recommends approval of your application, a draft of the proposed Bylaw to amend the Official Plan will also be included. Based on the planner's comprehensive report and the comments made at the public meeting, your application will be considered during a future regular meeting of the planning committee. The planning committee will then prepare its recommendation to City Council to approve your application with or without changes, reject your application or defer its decision until additional information is received. During a City Council meeting, Council may adopt the planning committee's recommendation, amend it, reject it or refer it back to the planning committee for further information. If your application is approved by City Council, the bylaw to adopt the Official Plan amendment will be given three readings at that City Council meeting. After City Council approves an Official Plan amendment, a 'Notice of Adoption' will be sent by the City Clerk within 15 days of Council's decision pursuant to the requirements of the Planning Act. This notice will include information on the Bylaw to adopt the Official Plan amendment and will provide a 20 day period within which an appeal of the Bylaw may be made to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. Any person with an interest in the matter may appeal the decision of City Council to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal provided that they made a presentation at the public meeting or provided a written submission prior to the decision being made. If no appeals to the bylaw are received, the city clerk will issue a declaration that no appeals were filed and that the Official Plan amendment has come into effect. If the bylaw is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the final decision regarding approval or rejection of your application will be made following a hearing process. After your application has been submitted, it will normally take four to six months to process the application to the stage where a recommendation can be made by City Council. The approval process may be longer for applications that propose major developments, deal with complex supporting information or extensive public input or require additional development approvals such as a Zoning Bylaw Amendment (note that if a Zoning Bylaw Amendment is also required, there may be an opportunity for the City to deal with both the Official Plan Amendment and Zoning Bylaw Amendment applications at the same time). If an application is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the hearing process will add time to the approval procedure as well.

Free parking is available on most residential streets in the central area of the City. However, most streets have time of day regulations (Monday to Friday), restricting parking an hour during the morning and afternoon to discourage all day parkers from overcrowding these residential streets. View the map of all existing and potential on street parking permit areas. The City offers a limited number of on street parking permits that accommodate a variety of parking needs for residents, commuters and temporary visitors, which exempt parkers from these limited weekday restrictions. A permit or exemption is typically not required to park on the street in the early morning, late afternoon, evening, overnight (April 1 \u2013 November 30), or anytime on the weekends. If your parking needs can be met within the posted time of day regulations, no permit is necessary.

The City has expanded the on street parking program to include portions of the Williamsville neighbourhood located south of York Street and west of Nelson Street. View area map. In this area a large number of non residents take up on street spots all day. This creates parking challenges for residents and for those seeking short term parking. The on street program allows for controlled parking by limiting the number of permits issued for all day parkers. The implementation also allows for controlled distribution of the parking supply and offers area residents predictable parking, while freeing up on street spots for those in need of short term parking. Most residents don't require a permit as there are no parking restrictions in the early morning, late afternoon, evening, overnight (with the exception of overnight winter regulations), weekend or on holidays. Permits are required for residents that need to park in morning or afternoon time restricted areas. Residents that require regular, all day, weekday on street parking will be issued a monthly permit that exempts parkers from all time of day restrictions. Permit holders are exempt from the daytime on street parking regulations.

Join the City as we commemorate and honour Kingston\u2019s rich and diverse heritage during Ontario\u2019s Heritage Week from February 21 to 27. This week is an opportunity for us to reflect on how our community has shaped Ontario\u2019s heritage, how our heritage is preserved, and how it will influence the future. Monday, Feb. 21 learn more about Kingston\u2019s heritage through objects and spend some time at home exploring the City\u2019s Civic Collection at City\u2019s Civic Collection. The Civic Collection includes a diverse range of objects and artworks documenting many stories, themes, makers, and materials which together help us to tell a broader story of our community. On Tuesday, Feb. 22 we will be honouring Natural Heritage by taking a moment to appreciate the vast, beautiful Kingston Trails and Wetlands. We are fortunate to live in a place that is surrounded by many conservation areas such as Gould Lake, Parrot\u2019s Bay, Little Cataraqui Creek to name a few, giving us an abundance of places to visit and explore. Each conservation area offers something unique and goes through amazing changes seasonally. This is a good week to visit a new trail or look out point. For Wednesday, Feb. 23 we have an exciting restoration update to mark Architectural Heritage! The facilities team at the City recently won an award for the restoration of the Cupolas at the Frontenac County Courthouse in 2021. Among the work that was tackled was the water infiltration into the building, which involved many other interior updates because of related deterioration. Most notably you will notice the new copper flashing elements and shingle dome roofs completed to help preserve these iconic heritage elements for the future. You might have visited Artillery Park for a swimming lesson, but did you know about the interesting display there called \u201cHistory Beneath Our Feet?\u201d On Thursday, Feb. 24, you can learn more about Kingston\u2019s Archaeological Heritage by taking in this exhibit which features objects discovered at Artillery Park in an excavation that took place in 2012 and 2013. The objects showcase a small glimpse into the lives of former inhabitants of the artillery park area. Friday, Feb. 25, is to mark Cultural Heritage and we are spotlighting the Engage for Change project. The Engage for Change project seeks to re frame the relationship between Indigenous and non Indigenous people in Kingston with the goal of supporting a community that integrates and respects Indigenous Peoples\u2019 identities, voices, languages, and culture.

The OLT approved the official plan and rezoning bylaw amendments recommended by the City for the Homestead Land Holdings project at 182 Ontario Street, 18 Queen Street and 51 57 Queen Street downtown, commonly referred to as the North Block. This is a very important decision for land use planning for the City as it sets a new standard for smart, well designed intensification in Kingston\u2019s downtown. This week, the Kingston Whig Standard newspaper ran an article about this decision, which I would like to address. The article included an outdated image of the proposed development, and a quote from the appellant\u2019s lawyer, implying that staff did a poor job justifying this decision. Both points have created some confusion in the community. The image of the proposed buildings included in the Whig\u2019s article was out of date and reflected the design before significant changes were negotiated city staff, which were then supported by City Council. The below is the correct version, taken directly from the evidence presented in the hearing. 18 Queen Street and 182 Ontario Street, commonly referred to as the North Block. Image courtesy of Roderick Lahey Architects Inc. A street level view of 51 57 Queen Street, block 3 of the proposed development. Image courtesy of Roderick Lahey Architects Inc. It\u2019s really important that the public see the right picture of exactly what was approved by the Tribunal to have an informed understanding of the development. Here's the even bigger problem: the Whig article ended with a substantial quote from David Donnelly, the lawyer for the appellants, who opposed the proposals. The quote suggested that the City's witnesses \u201cdid a poor job of justifying the controversial decision to approve the towers downtown and ignored their own climate emergency declaration and warnings of experts like Jennifer Keesmaat and George Baird that tall buildings are major contributors to the climate crisis.\u201d I would like to address the inaccurate claim by Mr. Donnelly on the job city staff did at the hearing. Staff did an exceptionally thorough, professional and commendable job at the hearing, so much so that the Tribunal was persuaded by and favored their evidence on all other matters, including the resolution of heritage issues. I felt compelled to clarify this matter for the community and for the staff who worked very hard to represent the City at this hearing. The OLT decision for the North Block proposals recognizes the steps the City has taken to preserve its built heritage resources through a layered and nuanced approach while being careful to identify areas of growth and intensification, responding to housing and employment needs, contributing to a vital and robust downtown, and meeting provincial and local climate objectives. The following is from the OLT\u2019s written decision: \"Communities are not static; they evolve. The conservation of cultural heritage resources brings the past into the present and helps shape the physical expression of a community. Growth and intensification respond to the community\u2019s current needs and planned function for the future; they also help shape the physical expression of a community.\" Let\u2019s address the claim that tall buildings in a downtown like ours are inconsistent with Council\u2019s declaration of a climate emergency. I might not be surprised that Mr. Baird, an architect who gave opposing testimony at the hearing, holds that opinion, but it was odd that Mr. Donnelly chose to reference former City of Toronto Chief Planner Jennifer Keesmaat in his quote. We reached out to Ms. Keesmaat, who had nothing to do with the hearing, but was invited to Kingston a few years ago to speak on sustainable city building and notified her of the Whig article. Ms. Keesmaat\u2019s response to reading the article was one of concern and she provided the followings thoughts for inclusion in this post: \"Our climate emergency combined with our housing emergency means we need to use land in our already built areas, like downtown Kingston and other mid sized cities, to create enough critical mass to house more people in walkable places. Do tall buildings downtown contribute to the climate emergency? The opposite is true. Denser, taller, well designed buildings have the potential to result in lower greenhouse gas emissions per capita from both a transportation and land use planning perspective. We need to add significantly more housing where infrastructure \u2013 like roads, transit, schools and parks \u2013 already exists. Doing so is one of the most essential ways that municipal councils can have a tangible impact on the climate crisis.\" Since Mr. Donnelly brought up \u201cexperts\u201d  presumably meaning experts other than City staff  I also showed the quote to our own city planning advisor, Brent Toderian, former Chief Planner for the City of Vancouver and a leading national and global advisor to cities of all sizes and vintages, and a foremost expert on sustainable city planning, revitalizing downtowns and mitigating the climate crisis through better city building. He shared this comment: \"Achieving higher housing densities in our downtowns, and in other settings where more walking, biking, transit ridership and other alternatives to driving exist or are aspired to, is one of the single MOST important things that cities can do to mitigate the climate crisis. Anyone suggesting the opposite, that taller, denser buildings downtown contribute to the climate emergency, is either misinformed or purposefully misinforming. Height without density is possible and can be problematic, as can height and density in car dependent locations; but when well designed building height specifically facilitates more housing density downtown as is the case with this proposal, then all sorts of public interest aspirations are achieved. Kingston has come a long way in recent years in understanding how to do tall buildings much better. That\u2019s a good thing, since taller and denser buildings downtown are critically important not only to address the climate emergency, but also to support a strengthened downtown; make better use of previous public infrastructure investment; support improved public health and lower public health costs; support more active transportation; improve social and economic equity and housing diversity; improve affordability; and even reduce the pressure for future municipal tax increases. In short, cities have a huge role to play in mitigating climate change, and land use density and transportation decisions are the two most significant tools that city councils have in their toolbox.\" I\u2019d also like to directly address a common misconception and suggestion that as a City we ignore our Official Plan and allow development to proceed wherever and however with insufficient regard for compatibility. The decision of the Tribunal addresses this matter directly as it relates to the proposed development through its general conclusions: the North Block lands have long been identified for intensification and redevelopment, are suitable for the proposed use and the building designs satisfy all land use compatibility tests of the Official Plan including visual intrusion. It\u2019s not typical for me to take time to address media articles, however we are at a critical time in our city where very tough, informed decisions need to be made. Tough conversations need to be had and getting the facts right is more important than ever. Misinformation is a disservice to our community and needs to be clarified wherever possible. Council has set the ambitious goal of meeting the Climate Emergency head on, and staff in every municipal department are making the effort to connect the dots on every decision we make regarding the City\u2019s land use, transportation planning and city building. That\u2019s not easy, and it\u2019s taking hard work. It helps a lot if the public has the most factual information made available as we all try to make better decisions for our city\u2019s future. The decision is a positive step forward for our city \u2013 albeit one that took six years to complete. It is representative of a project that can move forward with well designed density being supported in our downtown. While the units are not anticipated to be \u201caffordable housing\u201d based on the City\u2019s current definition, every new unit on the market helps by providing housing choices in strategic locations and expanding our overall supply. The City is working on a variety of other interventions with community partners, in addition to developments proposed by the private sector, that specifically focus on addressing gaps within the full housing continuum, like the need for additional supportive, transitional and affordable units. These buildings are reflective of the \u201c15 minute neighbourhood\u201d concept being championed in the planning profession by locating housing in direct proximity to people\u2019s daily needs in walkable distances. By adding 400 new residential units to the downtown, the redevelopments will add vibrancy to our downtown as we not only work to recover from the pandemic, but also for Kingston\u2019s future generations. So where do things go from here? The Homestead proposals for the North Block will need to proceed through the site plan process before building permits can be issued. This involves the detailed design phase of a building site. This will unfold over the months to come and the community will be able to access information related to DASH once filed.

How this project will reduce GHG emissions: Sustainable Kingston\u2019s Registered Energy Advisors (REA) travel throughout the City of Kingston and neighbouring municipalities conducting energy assessments for various energy related incentive programs. The REAs currently use their own gas powered vehicles. From June 3, 2022, to August 17, 2022, a total of 51 energy assessments were conducted in Kingston and another 39 in the surrounding area. This work related travel resulted in 2,641 km within Kington resulting in an estimated 235 L of gasoline being consumed producing 540.68 kg of Co2 emissions (0.54 tonnes of Co2). Additional benefits: The purchase of an electric vehicle for use by the Registered Energy Advisors will have an estimated annual direct reduction of Co2 within the City of Kingston of 886.71 Kg of Co2 (0.89 tonnes of Co2) and provide an annual cost saving of $2,252.52. Work related travel in nearby municipalities will save an additional $8.626.86 and result in Co2 reductions of 3,396 Kg of Co2 (3.4 tonnes of Co2). For a combined total of $10,879 in annual cost savings and reduce a total of 4,282.71 Kg of Co2 (4.28 tonnes of Co2). The nature of the service is to support homeowners to reduce their own Co2 emissions by implementing home upgrades based on our advisors\u2019 recommendations. By having a company branded electric vehicle will help promote available programs and electric vehicles potentially resulting in greater Co2 reductions in Kingston and the surrounding area.

The Heritage Properties Register, lists properties in Kingston recognized to have cultural heritage, value or interest. The Register includes a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Rideau Canal and the Kingston Fortifications), National Historic Sites, Provincially significant properties, municipally designated properties under the Ontario Heritage Act and \"listed\" properties (also known as non designated, or properties of cultural heritage value). The City's Heritage Properties Register is a dynamic document with new information being added on a regular basis. Please note that the information is provided for the purposes of convenience only. At the municipal level, there are two types of designations under the Ontario Heritage Act \u2013 Part IV and Part V. Part IV designations refer to individual heritage properties. Part V designations refer to a grouping of heritage properties known as a Heritage Conservation District. Designation under the Ontario Heritage Act is applied by the passing of a municipal bylaw to recognize and to promote good stewardship of the District's cultural heritage value. Exterior alterations to buildings located on designated properties generally require a Heritage Permit. In Kingston, work that promotes restoration and preservation of designated buildings may be eligible for grants. Work to designated properties that also have a heritage easement agreement registered on the property may be eligible for the City's Heritage Property Tax Refund Program. Section 27 of the Ontario Heritage Act allows municipalities to list or inventory properties of cultural heritage value that are not designated under Part IV or Part V of the Act. These properties are not afforded the same level of protection as a designated property. While a Heritage Permit is not required for alterations to the property, owners are always welcome to seek staff advice. An owner of a \"listed\" property is required to give Council 60 days notice of their intention to demolish a building (or portion of a building) on the property. Heritage easement agreements are another tool to ensure a property's preservation. It is a legal agreement registered on title between the City or the Ontario Heritage Trust and the owner of the property. Heritage easement agreements are entered into to ensure heritage attributes of a building are maintained in perpetuity and may also set out permitted alterations and development. Eligible works to properties with a heritage easement agreement that are also designated under the Ontario Heritage Act may be eligible for the City's Heritage Property Tax Refund Program. The Province owns many properties whose history contributes to the greater history of Ontario. The Province has developed Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Provincial Heritage Properties to preserve, protect and promote the cultural heritage value of these provincially significant properties. National Historic Sites are places that are of immense importance to Canada. Each National Historic Site contributes to the greater history of Canada. In Kingston, the National Historic Sites include the Frontenac County Courthouse, City Hall, Fort Henry and more. United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Culture Organization (UNESCO) seek to protect, manage and safeguard tangible and intangible cultural heritage. UNESCO has identified over 900 properties of cultural and natural heritage that have outstanding value on a universal scale. In Kingston the Rideau Canal and Kingston's Fortifications are identified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

This work continues and an annual update on the implementation of these recommendations is provided to City Council. In 2015, the Age friendly Kingston Community Alliance (AFKCA) was formed to carry on the work of the Age friendly Plan and to expand the scope to the broader community.

This ensemble of exceptional individual properties includes repre\u00adsentative examples of architectural styles and types that demonstrate nearly two centuries of social, economic and political change and development in the City. The centre of the District is the site of the historic marketplace, Springer Market Square, dating from 1801, and Kingston's City Hall, a National Historic Site (built originally in 1843  1844). Springer Market Square is associated with many people and events of great signif\u00adicance to the history of both Kingston and Canada. The Square was shelled by Col. John Bradstreet's British troops during the battle of Fort Frontenac in 1758. A military blockhouse was located onsite during the War of 1812. The area also served as the assembly ground for troops going to fight in the Northwest Rebellion, the Boer Wars and the First and Second World Wars. Many significant political events took place at Springer Market Square, such as the proclamation of Upper Canada as a separate jurisdiction by Governor John Graves Simcoe in 1792, the proclamation and celebration of Confederation on July 1, 1867 and the funeral procession of Sir John A. Macdonald in 1891. Springer Market Square, the surrounding sidewalks, street pattern and properties remain an active part of Kingston's downtown core and continue to accommodate many of the market, civic, commercial and residential uses that have existed there for more than two centuries.

What is known is that communities of Late Woodland people (approximately 1200 to 1450) and the St. Lawrence Iroquois (16th century) were known to occupy this region and later developed or merged into their modern descendant First Nations. When the first Europeans began to arrive in the 17th century, the north shore of Lake Ontario and the area originally known as Katarokwi had continued to provide a home base for the Huron Wendat Peoples and the Five Nations/St. Lawrence Iroquois. In the Mohawk language, the name Katarokwi means a place where there is clay or where the limestone is. The Algonquin term Cataracoui means great meeting place and was translated by the French into Cataraqui that can be found all over Kingston today. In the late 17th century, various families of Seneca, Cayuga and Mohawk ancestry had established communities at both the western and eastern ends of Lake Ontario and at various spots heading east up the shores of the St. Lawrence River. At the same time\u2014as French traders, military personnel and settlers made their way west across the region\u2014they aligned themselves with many of the Algonquin and Huron traders they first encountered along the St. Lawrence River, the northern shores of Lake Ontario and various inland waterways. During a similar period of time the Five Nations Confederacy aligned themselves with the British and helped to overrun many of the French, Huron and Anishinaabe settlements along the lower St. Lawrence and Great Lakes waterway. The Mississauga who had established a community in the region in the early 18th century ceded Katarokwi and the surrounding territory to the British crown in 1783 with the signing of the Crawford Purchase. It was at this time that Sir William Johnson's consort, Molly Brant, a Mohawk woman of distinction and exemplary speaker in multiple languages, negotiated the safe passage and land acquisition for the Mohawks from the Mohawk Valley to Kingston across to Deseronto. Molly Brant, the sister of the Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant (who established the Six Nations of Brantford), was a resident of Kingston until her passing in 1796 and was buried at St. Paul's Church on Queen at Bagot Streets. During the American Revolution, the United Empire Loyalists and Mohawk warriors shared a desire to move peacefully into British Upper Canada territory and continued to trade with the Iroquois Confederacy and Anishinaabe in and around Katarokwi. Market Square, behind what is now Kingston City Hall was the main trading location where food stuffs (especially rice), tobacco and hides exchanged hands between First Peoples, the United Empire Loyalists and other recent immigrants to the established British Colony of Upper Canada right up until modern times. On June 22, 2015, The City of Kingston approved for the first time a Recognition Statement to be read at the beginning of each Council Meeting and on other ceremonial occasions. This Recognition Statement was drafted in consultation with the Indigenous community to be offered at the beginning of a gathering as a way of saying \u201cwelcome and thank you for coming\u201d. It represents just one of a series of separate, yet related initiatives that have been pursued in recent years out of a desire to acknowledge and strengthen relations with Indigenous people at a local level. \u201cI offer these words in the spirit of this gathering. Let us bring our good minds and hearts together as one, to honour and celebrate these traditional lands as a gathering place of the Original Peoples and their Ancestors who were entrusted to care for Mother Earth since time immemorial. It is with deep humility, that we acknowledge and offer our gratitude for their contributions to this community, having respect for all as we share this space now and walk side by side into the future.\u201d Engage for Change is a multi phase project that seeks to re frame the relationship between Indigenous People and non Indigenous people in Kingston, especially as it relates to history, knowledge and culture.

The Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act applies to all local government organizations, including: There are separate Acts that apply specifically to provincial ministries, agencies and federal government institutions. Effective January 1, 1991, MFIPPA requires municipal institutions to protect the privacy of an individual's personal information existing in government records and provides a right of access to information held by the municipal institution. The Act creates a privacy protection scheme the government must follow to protect an individual's right to privacy. The scheme includes rules regarding the collection, use, disclosure and disposal of personal information in the custody and control of a municipal institution. In keeping with the spirit of the legislation, the City of Kingston is committed to providing individuals with the right of access to information in its custody and control including most operational records as well as records containing their own personal information, where applicable. This process is called routine disclosure and allows certain records to be disclosed, without having to make a formal request under the Act. Only under limited circumstances does the City require an individual to make a formal MFIPPA request. The MFIPPA legislation states that an institution must provide the requester with the information and/or a decision regarding their request within 30 calendar days from the date a complete request is received. On occasion, an institution may ask for an extension, if the request is for an extensive number of records and/or if an outside third party needs to be contacted. Each municipal organization is required to appoint a head who is responsible for overseeing the administration of the legislation within the institution and for decisions made under the legislation. At the City of Kingston, City Council, by bylaw, designated the Mayor as the head, who in turn delegated the powers and duties of the head to the Manager of the Council Support Division (City Clerk). The City Clerk forms access and privacy procedures for use by City staff, is responsible for processing all access requests, gives direction to City staff on informal information requests and implements privacy protection practices.

School crossings are strategically located near elementary schools that are part of the Limestone District School Board and the Algonquin and Lakeshore Catholic District School Board. School crossing locations are based on several factors, including the number of students who use the crossing and the number of conflicting vehicle movements. School crossing guards are located at: School crossings are staffed for a minimum of 35 minutes near arrival and dismissal times. Some locations may also be staffed during school lunch breaks. While the City strives to provide excellent service during the school year, crossing guard services may be temporarily interrupted due to extreme weather conditions and unforeseen circumstances.

Neighbourhood Area Speed Limits can help set consistent expectations for motorists across a community, encouraging careful and cautious driving through the area. Community Safety Zones also help to reinforce safe and attentive driving, especially in school areas where families may be walking or cycling to school. Speed limit reductions and Community Safety Zones are being implemented in a phased approach to allow monitoring and evaluation of the programs. In two pilot areas \u2013 Westwoods and Strathcona Park \u2013 the City has introduced neighbourhood wide Area Speed Limit reductions to 40 km/h, school area speed limit reductions to 30 km/h, and the introduction of Community Safety Zones in the immediate area surrounding schools. Community Safety Zones are also planned to be introduced at all schools in Kingston. Community Safety Zones are a distinct regulatory tool from posted speed limits and are intended to remind motorists that they are driving in an area with higher volumes of pedestrians and vulnerable road users, such as near schools. Community Safety Zones encourage individuals to slow down and drive with increased care. The rules of the road for driving do not change within a Community Safety Zone. However, the fines for many traffic violations, including for speeding, are doubled within Community Safety Zones to encourage safe driving and to improve compliance with posted speed limits. In Kingston, Community Safety Zones are being installed at all schools in Kingston to improve driver awareness of the presence of pedestrians in proximity to schools and encouraging safer driving in these priority areas. Community Safety Zones (CSZs) will be introduced at all schools in Kingston by the Fall of 2023. This will provide consistent messaging to motorists at schools citywide and allows for enhanced enforcement in these priority areas. View the full Neighbourhood Community Safety Zones map. In order to meet the City\u2019s target of implementing CSZs at 50+ schools by Fall 2023, the associated planning, design, field investigation, communications, and installation work will be carried out in three rounds, with Round 1 installations scheduled for Fall 2022. Planning and design work will continue through the winter, allowing for the Round 2 CSZ installations to be completed in Spring Summer 2023, and Round 3 installations in Summer Fall 2023. CSZs will be introduced at the following schools in Round 1 (Fall 2022): Round 2 CSZ installations, scheduled for Spring Summer 2023, tentatively include the following schools: Round 3 CSZ installations, scheduled for Summer Fall 2023, tentatively include the following schools: Neighbourhood Area Speed Limits are zones where the speed limit has been reduced to 40 km/h for all roads within that designated area, unless posted otherwise.

This signage includes \u2018AREA\u2019 and \u2018BEGINS\u2019 or \u2018ENDS\u2019 tabs below the posted speed limit. The existing speed limits on main roadways bordering the designated area are not affected. A conceptual map illustrating how Area Speed Limits can be applied is shown below. The first phase was introduced in advance of the 2022/2023 school year and involved pilot projects in the Westwoods and Strathcona Park neighbourhoods. Within the two pilot neighbourhoods, Area Speed Limits reduced the speed limit on local streets to 40 km/h, the school area speed limit was reduced to 30 km/h, and Community Safety Zones were introduced in the immediate area surrounding schools. In the Westwoods neighbourhood, a speed limit of 40 km/h applies to all streets bounded by Princess Street to the north, Bayridge Drive to the east, Taylor Kidd Boulevard to the south, and Collins Bay Road to the west. An additional speed limit reduction to 30 km/h applies along the school frontages on Lancaster Drive. A Community Safety Zone surrounding the schools encourages safe driving and allows for enhanced enforcement with increased fines for speeding. In the Strathcona Park neighbourhood, a speed limit of 40 km/h applies to all streets bounded by John Counter Boulevard to the north, Sir John A. MacDonald Boulevard to the east, Princess Street to the south, and Portsmouth Avenue to the west. An additional speed limit reduction to 30 km/h applies along the school frontages on McMahon Avenue. A Community Safety Zone surrounding the schools encourages safe driving and allows for enhanced enforcement with increased fines for speeding. Monitoring and evaluation of the Neighbourhood pilot projects and the assessments undertaken for the implementation of Community Safety Zones at all schools will inform future expansion opportunities of the speed limit reduction principles to other locations throughout the city, where appropriate.

The neighbourhood level cycling network will provide routes and facilities within each area and will connect to the city wide transportation and transit network. Neighbourhood cycling trips will occur on local roads and along neighbourhood trails and pathways. Neighbourhood routes will also be more geared to shorter trips to locations such as a school, library, corner store, or community centre. In the short term, the City will focus on developing a series of neighbourhood transportation plans, called Transportation Focus Area Plans. These will help City staff identify short and long term transportation priorities within each focus area and guide future decision making and planning for active transportation at a neighbourhood level. See a larger view of the map. City wide active transportation routes have also been identified to be prioritized in the short term. The routes illustrated above were developed to arrange the city wide network into continuous routes and outline key north south and east west connections. By assembling components of the cycling network into routes, the City can improve the connectivity of the overall network. The network will become more useful as the gaps between cycling facilities are addressed. Kingston's proposed city wide cycling network upgrades can be found in the map below. See a larger view of the map. Proposed city wide cycling network The city wide active transportation network is intended to address large scale mobility concerns and issues that impact the City as whole rather than specific issues at a local level.

The study was intended to guide building design within the Downtown and Harbour Area Study Area. It generally includes Princess, Queen and Brock Streets from Division Street to the harbour and the area generally expands from Bay Street to William Street including the waterfront area. The historic Market Square District and City Hall are within the study area. The findings of the Downtown and Harbour Architectural Guidelines Study, including the proposed land use policy framework, will be used as background information for the Comprehensive Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw Review. The Downtown and Harbour Area Architectural Guidelines Study is part of the background information that is needed to prepare the updated city of Kingston Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw. It will identify architectural guidelines for These guidelines will help to ensure that proposed developments in old or new buildings are compatible with existing built forms and features. It will also implement Official Plan policies for the former city of Kingston that address the need to preserve the historical and cultural character of the core area. The City of Kingston recognizes the value of its historic architecture and streetscapes in the downtown and harbour area. The city's downtown is distinctive in Ontario. In addition to City Hall, which has been described as one of the finest historical buildings in Ontario, there is a wide range of other institutional, retail, office and residential uses in buildings dating back over three centuries. Courtyards and passageways between buildings, once used as carriageways and laneways, have also been redeveloped as outdoor cafes and unique pedestrian passages. The downtown area is also noted for its scenic waterfront. Existing Official Plan policies protect selected waterfront views. There are also a number of waterfront uses such as Confederation Park, Confederation Basin Marina and various hotels, apartments, museums, restaurants and wharves that serve the Wolfe Island Ferry and summer tour boats. Despite the historic and cultural value of the downtown and harbour area, there are no architectural guidelines currently in place for this area as a whole. Developing guidelines that deal with the unique characteristics of the downtown and harbour area will help to ensure that renovations, additions and new developments are compatible with existing built forms and features. The Downtown and Harbour Area Architectural Guidelines Study involved the following series of integrated steps: Preparing an Architectural Character Statement: Since the downtown and harbour area contains a wide range of land uses and building types, the study will focus on areas in more detail through an 'Architectural Character Statement' that will outline the following: Preparing an Architectural Character Plan: The Architectural Character Statement will provide the basis for an 'Architectural Character Plan', which will discuss how old and new buildings can complement each other and how the character of the downtown and harbour area can be protected and enhanced. An important part of the Architectural Character Plan will be to determine whether the existing land use regulations in the Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw for the former city of Kingston address future land use needs in the area. Preparing the Downtown and Harbour Area Architectural Guidelines: The Architectural Character Statement and Architectural Character Plan will be used to prepare the 'Downtown and Harbour Area Architectural Guidelines'. These guidelines will focus on elements such as building form and scale, colours and materials as well as streetscape and courtyard relationships for newly constructed buildings and alterations/additions to existing buildings. Public Consultation: In order to plan properly for the future, it will be important throughout the study process that the public is engaged in a discussion of architectural design issues and options in the core area. A number of opportunities to consult with the public are being planned and will run until the Downtown and Harbour Area Architectural Guidelines Study has been completed. From web page updates, to workshops, stakeholder meetings and open houses, the city of Kingston wants your feedback about how development in the downtown and harbour area should be guided in the future. The consulting team of Baird Sampson Neuert Architects was contracted to complete the Downtown and Harbour Area Architectural Guidelines Study with the direct involvement of the city's planning and development department, other city staff and external stakeholder groups and agencies.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/recreation/parks-trails#map": "Whether you're going for a stroll, taking a jog or just enjoying the lake views, Kingston offers more than 200 beautiful parks you can visit year round.

On September 20, 2016, City Council gave final reading to Bylaw 2016 173 to enact the new Village of Barriefield Heritage Conservation District Plan. The new plan replaces the current Barriefield Heritage Conservation District Plan, last updated in 1992. The Barriefield Heritage Conservation District is one of three established Heritage Conservation Districts in Kingston. Barriefield Village sits on a high embankment on the eastern shore of the Great Cataraqui River (a portion of the Rideau Canal World Heritage Site). It is located near the intersection of Highway 2 and Kingston Road 15, adjacent to Fort Henry (a National Historic Site of Canada), and CFB Kingston in the former Township of Pittsburgh, which is now part of the City of Kingston. Barriefield has a long association with the history of European settlement and military activity in the Kingston area. Named after the commissioner of the Kingston Naval Dockyard, Commodore Sir Robert Barrie (in 1820), Barriefield Village was established around 1814 as a result of the need for developable land for housing. At this time, there was increased activity in the area in response to the War of 1812 and the reconstruction of Fort Henry in the 1830's. This quaint village has a distinctive building style typically consisting of low profile one and a half storey homes of wood frame or stone construction. Buildings are primarily single detached residences with a few semi detached or row type houses. Although many buildings and properties have been altered over time, and new buildings have been added to the Village, the overall nineteenth century rural character of the Village of Barriefield has been retained. 216 Ontario Street Kingston, ON K7L 2Z3", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/business/planning-and-development/planning-studies/land-review": "The Employment Land Strategy Review Study was completed by Watson and Associates Economists Ltd. in association with Dillon Consulting Limited in March 2015.

Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A backwater valve, also called a backflow valve, is a device used to prevent outbound water in a home\u2019s drain pipes from re entering, or \u201cbackflowing\u201d\u2014into your home. The valve has a flap that allows water to leave but closes to prevent water and/or sewage from entering. Backwater valves are designed to close the sewer line during periods of extreme rain to prevent water from entering your home. When the valve is closed you should not use any plumbing fixtures (i.e. toilets, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines) because water will not drain and will back up into your home. The Insurance Bureau of Canada recommends residents not install the plug type valves, as they allow sewer backup pressure to build beneath your basement floor, which may cause structural damage to your home. $500 to $2,000 including installation. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. Early detection of water leakage can help you quickly determine the cause and source of the leak and address it before flooding occurs. Flood alarms, also known as, flood detectors, water alarms or water detectors are electronic devices that detect the presence of water and set off an alarm when its sensors are triggered. Flood alarms come in different shapes and sizes and with a wide range of features. New models have WiFi capabilities with smart home integration. $25 to $150 Cool roofs reflect the sun\u2019s rays and reduce heat build up through a light coloured or highly reflective roofing product such as a coating, new membrane or shingle. Most roofs in Canada are dark in colour and absorb heat from the sun\u2019s rays transferring it into the rooms below. Because cool roofs are better at reflecting the sun\u2019s energy, less heat is transferred inside your home. As a result, you may not have to use your air conditioner as much, saving you energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cool roofs also increase the life expectancy of your roof, because they reflect the heat and UV rays that damage and age roof materials. Dark coloured roofs in high density areas also contribute to the urban heat island effect \u2013 significantly warmer temperatures in urban areas compared to rural areas. As a result of climate change, Kingston is expected to see dramatic increases in the number of extremely hot days due to continued global warming. Installing a cool roof is one way to help to offset this. There are cool roof options for all types of roofs, including steep slope (pitched roofs), low slope (flat roofs).. Roofing products are tested for their reflectivity and given a Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value between 0 100. The higher the number, the more reflective it is. If you want to convert an existing roof into a cool roof, you have the following options: Green roofs are living roofs. They support the growth of vegetation and consist of a waterproofing membrane, drainage layer, organic growing medium (soil), and vegetation. Green roofs capture stormwater, improve air quality and create habitats for pollinators, birds and other wildlife. Green roofs also help insulate your home in the summer and help reduce the overall temperature in Kingston. Green roof systems are generally classified as extensive, semi intensive or intensive. Your budget, vision and the structural capacity of your building will determine which type of green roof you select. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A sump pump is a small pump that is installed at the lowest part of your basement or crawlspace that prevents flooding. The sump is the low space that collects liquids, while the sump pump detects water in the sump and moves it away from your home through a network of pipes that is dug into the floor of the basement. Groundwater can easily rise through the cracks in your foundation during long periods of rain. If there is a possibility that flooding can occur in your basement or crawl space, a sump pump will collect all of this water and redirect it away from your home. There are two types of primary sump pumps available: submersible and pedestal pumps. Submersible pumps have the motor placed underwater in your sump basin, while pedestal pumps are positioned with the pump motor out of the water, above your sump basin. It is recommended that Kingston residents consider a submersible sump pump as they are the quietest, most powerful and effective sump pump. They also allow for an airtight lid that will stop debris from falling into the pit and prevent moisture and odorous air from being released into your home. $700 to $5,000, including installation.

They are also a good option for residents in high rise buildings without central air conditioning. $200 to $600 Source: Natural Resources Canada Space and water heating are the biggest users of energy in Canadian homes which accounts for approximately 80per cent of residential energy consumption and 99per cent of GHG emissions in Ontario residences Boilers use gas or oil to provide space heating and hot water to your home. Boilers distribute heat using radiators or in floor radiant heating, eliminating the need for pre existing duct systems. Gas and oil boilers are subject to Canada\u2019s Energy Efficiency Regulations, which sets minimum performance standards for their energy efficiency. All boilers sold in Canada are energy efficient. Check the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) rating, the minimum should be between 82 and 84 per cent. Replacing your oil boiler? Consider switching to a natural gas boiler which tends to produce less waste and fewer harmful emissions. $3,000 to $8,000 Source: Natural Resources Canada If your house, or a room, has moist or wet stains on a wall or ceiling, musty odours, windows or pipes that are covered with condensation, and/or feels stuffy, you may need a dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers regulate the humidity in a room by removing excess moisture from the air, thereby creating a living condition that is inhospitable to dust mites, mould and other allergenic organisms. They run quietly and efficiently in the background without most people even noticing. There are two types of dehumidifiers available, portable and whole house. For significant, year round issues of high humidity, get a whole house dehumidifier that uses your home\u2019s heating and cooling system to reduce the humidity throughout your entire house. If the humidity is periodic or confined to one room, a portable unit is sufficient. Whole house units $1,000 \u2013 $2,000+; portable units $150 \u2013 $300.

Drain water heat recovery systems capture the heat from water going down a drain, typically the shower, and use it to heat cold water entering your water heater. It\u2019s particularly effective when there are simultaneous water flows i.e. when you\u2019re using hot water in the shower at the same time that water is flowing down the drain. $550 \u2013 $1,700 plus installation.

High efficiency gas furnaces are quiet, reliable, and effective at maintaining a comfortable home, and they can reduce your energy bill by up to 45 per cent. An ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified forced air furnace, fueled by gas uses 6 per cent less energy, fueled by oil uses 9 per cent less energy, on average than a standard model. Space heating represents more than half of your home\u2019s energy use and offers the most potential for reducing your energy bill. If your furnace was installed before 1990, it\u2019s probably a lower efficiency model, as regulations for furnaces in Canada have been updated since then. If you upgrade to an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified furnace, you will save money and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases you emit. $2,000 \u2013 $8,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Space heating accounts for 60per cent of the energy used in the average Canadian home. For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation.

A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air. Choose an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ductless heating and cooling system to cut your electrical heating bill by up to 60 per cent, and your cooling bill by 30 per cent, depending on your climate. $2,500 to $5,000+ per unit, including installation.

If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures. Ground source heating produce less CO2 than other forms of space heating systems. $20,000 \u2013 $40,000, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Homes built after 1977 are typically more airtight, which helps to prevent heat loss but also prevents air circulation, which is important for your health and comfort. Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems.

Water heaters with storage tanks are the most common in Canadian homes, but they are not the most energy efficient. Electricity, gas or oil is used to heat water stored in the tank and supply it, as needed, to household fixtures and appliances. Storage tanks typically hold between 113 and 378 litres of water in their tanks, and this water is continuously reheated and kept hot 24 hours a day. $800 to $1,500, plus installation.

Tankless water heaters heat water as it flows, and only when required, using an electric element or gas burner. They provide endless hot water and the heat on demand feature means you only pay to heat water as you use it, instead of paying to keep a tank of water heated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. $1,000 to $2,800 Source: Natural Resources Canada", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/resident/better-homes-kingston/assessments-upgrades-retrofits/five-steps": "When it comes to a good retrofit, strategy matters. It is important to take the right approach and do things in the right order as this will save money, energy, and time. Energy efficiency starts with your home\u2019s \u201cenvelope\u201d. The envelope is everything on the outside of your home that keeps your home protected from heat or cold. The building envelope separates the interior and exterior of your home. It includes your windows, doors, roof, floor, foundations, and insulation. When it comes to energy efficiency, an airtight building envelope the first step. All envelope work is about sealing. This includes filling holes and cracks, tightening seals, improving walls and attics (with insulation) and upgrading entries (windows, doors). Here\u2019s what you can do: For more information, see our Upgrade Directory. Your home is sealed and insulated. Now it\u2019s time to look at your heating and cooling system to save energy, reduce GHG emissions and make your home more comfortable. Not to mention the potential cost savings you could experience as a result of reduced energy use. Heating and cooling systems include heat pumps, furnace, boiler, baseboard heaters, water heaters and air conditioners \u2013 all the things that heat and cool your home. Space and water heating are the biggest users of energy in Canadian homes, accounting for approximately 80 per cent of residential energy consumption and nearly 100 per cent of GHG emissions in Ontario residences. Here\u2019s what you can do: Tips: Looking for more information? Go to our Upgrade Directory to dive deeper into the kinds of building envelop upgrades that will help you save on energy! When we increase electrification, emissions go down, and demand for clean, green electricity goes up. That\u2019s where renewables come in. Tip: Having a home powered by renewable energy with battery storage makes you resilient in the face of extreme weather events and power outages. You\u2019ve covered the big three (building envelope, heating and cooling, and renewable energy), so now you can consider doubling down on your investments with energy saving smart tech and reducing your day to day usage even more by switching out devices. If you\u2019re a renter, live in someone else\u2019s home or you just aren\u2019t ready for the big moves quite yet, you can always start with these supplemental measures. Smart tech and energy efficient devices help you to save energy, money, and emissions without having to change your habits. That\u2019s why households that install these devices save more energy than those don\u2019t. Here\u2019s what you can do: A Smart Thermostat creates 12 per cent energy savings in an average home, by taking the thinking out of good energy habits. Technological solutions, such as this, and energy efficient devices save energy, money, and emissions, wherever you are, and whatever your living situation, and there are rebates and free programs to help you get these devices into your home at low cost. An energy efficient home reduces energy use and emissions, and that takes us a good part of the way toward a healthy, secure future home. But as our climate changes, we will want our homes to be resilient to the changing weather to keep us safe and healthy. Here are some ways you can prepare your home for next level resilience. The good news: many of these measures are included in the Better Homes Kingston Program through financing options and other incentives. You can protect your home from a range of water related issues with devices like a backwater valve, a sump pump, or flood alarms. You can also minimize the risk to your property by implementing stormwater management measures, including window well covers, permeable pavement, rain gardens, and rain barrels. Residents of Kingston who receive a utility bill from Utilities Kingston can access their rain barrel program. Learn more here. Climate projections for Kingston suggest that by 2050 the number of days per year when the temperature is greater than 30 degree Celsius will increase from 4 days to 30 days. And even today, we know that the city heat island effect can significantly increase temperatures within the city and our homes. One way to reduce the heat impact on your home is to install a light coloured roof that reflect the sun back away from your home. This can reduce energy use and local temperatures! A green roof (a roof developed so that plants can grow on it) can tick multiple boxes for resilience. It keeps heat in during the winter, cools the roof (and therefore, the building) in summer, absorbs water during storms, and provides an extended green area to support air quality and reduce the heat island effect. A green roof can be a great option when considering next level resilience measures.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/resident/better-homes-kingston/assessments-upgrades-retrofits/plan-your-retrofit": "Planning an effective home energy retrofit can seem confusing if you are not familiar with the process, technologies, and approaches used; and planning is incredibly important to ensure a home energy retrofit achieves maximum outcomes.

Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A backwater valve, also called a backflow valve, is a device used to prevent outbound water in a home\u2019s drain pipes from re entering, or \u201cbackflowing\u201d\u2014into your home. The valve has a flap that allows water to leave but closes to prevent water and/or sewage from entering. Backwater valves are designed to close the sewer line during periods of extreme rain to prevent water from entering your home. When the valve is closed you should not use any plumbing fixtures (i.e. toilets, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines) because water will not drain and will back up into your home. The Insurance Bureau of Canada recommends residents not install the plug type valves, as they allow sewer backup pressure to build beneath your basement floor, which may cause structural damage to your home. $500 to $2,000 including installation. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. Early detection of water leakage can help you quickly determine the cause and source of the leak and address it before flooding occurs. Flood alarms, also known as, flood detectors, water alarms or water detectors are electronic devices that detect the presence of water and set off an alarm when its sensors are triggered. Flood alarms come in different shapes and sizes and with a wide range of features. New models have WiFi capabilities with smart home integration. $25 to $150 Cool roofs reflect the sun\u2019s rays and reduce heat build up through a light coloured or highly reflective roofing product such as a coating, new membrane or shingle. Most roofs in Canada are dark in colour and absorb heat from the sun\u2019s rays transferring it into the rooms below. Because cool roofs are better at reflecting the sun\u2019s energy, less heat is transferred inside your home. As a result, you may not have to use your air conditioner as much, saving you energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cool roofs also increase the life expectancy of your roof, because they reflect the heat and UV rays that damage and age roof materials. Dark coloured roofs in high density areas also contribute to the urban heat island effect \u2013 significantly warmer temperatures in urban areas compared to rural areas. As a result of climate change, Kingston is expected to see dramatic increases in the number of extremely hot days due to continued global warming. Installing a cool roof is one way to help to offset this. There are cool roof options for all types of roofs, including steep slope (pitched roofs), low slope (flat roofs).. Roofing products are tested for their reflectivity and given a Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value between 0 100. The higher the number, the more reflective it is. If you want to convert an existing roof into a cool roof, you have the following options: Green roofs are living roofs. They support the growth of vegetation and consist of a waterproofing membrane, drainage layer, organic growing medium (soil), and vegetation. Green roofs capture stormwater, improve air quality and create habitats for pollinators, birds and other wildlife. Green roofs also help insulate your home in the summer and help reduce the overall temperature in Kingston. Green roof systems are generally classified as extensive, semi intensive or intensive. Your budget, vision and the structural capacity of your building will determine which type of green roof you select. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A sump pump is a small pump that is installed at the lowest part of your basement or crawlspace that prevents flooding. The sump is the low space that collects liquids, while the sump pump detects water in the sump and moves it away from your home through a network of pipes that is dug into the floor of the basement. Groundwater can easily rise through the cracks in your foundation during long periods of rain. If there is a possibility that flooding can occur in your basement or crawl space, a sump pump will collect all of this water and redirect it away from your home. There are two types of primary sump pumps available: submersible and pedestal pumps. Submersible pumps have the motor placed underwater in your sump basin, while pedestal pumps are positioned with the pump motor out of the water, above your sump basin. It is recommended that Kingston residents consider a submersible sump pump as they are the quietest, most powerful and effective sump pump. They also allow for an airtight lid that will stop debris from falling into the pit and prevent moisture and odorous air from being released into your home. $700 to $5,000, including installation.

The Integrity Commissioner will provide accountability services to the City including: This is a summary of the complaint protocol. Complaints can be informal or formal. Informal complaints are a means of remedying the behaviour or activity believed to violate the Code of Conduct. The parties involved are encouraged to take advantage of the Integrity Commissioner's potential role as a mediator/conciliator of issues relating to a complaint. Please refer to the full complaint protocol for details on the treatment of formal complaints. Formal complaints should be submitted via written request.

Complaints may be filed by following the complaint protocol (above) and are filed with the Integrity Commissioner. A formal investigation is undertaken if the complainant wishes to forego the opportunity for a resolution of the complaint through the informal complaint mechanism. The official is given a copy of the complaint and asked to respond in writing to the complaint. A copy of this response is provided to the complainant. Should the response not be sufficient to resolve the complaint, the Integrity Commissioner will further investigate the matter. The process could include an interview with the complainant and the Integrity Commissioner. Within 90 days of filing the complaint, the Integrity Commissioner submits a report to Council, detailing any contravention of the Code of Conduct and any recommendations. Council determines what action will be taken. The Integrity Commissioner does not have any authority over City employees as they are subject to a separate Code of Conduct. The activities of the Integrity Commissioner relate only to the Code of Conduct for Council, Local Board and Council Committee members. The Complaint Protocol makes no provision for anonymous complaints or for withholding the complainant's name.

It is shaped by Council priorities, financial parameters, and legislative constraints and is guided by cost effective, efficient, and sustainable solutions. Municipal operating and capital budgets are funded primarily by property taxes, user fees and grants, and transfers from other levels of government. Each year, municipalities are required to balance their budgets and to allocate a set amount of funding to service areas in order to maintain service levels. Unlike provincial and federal government levels, municipalities are not allowed to budget for deficits. The City maintains four year operating budget projections as well as 15 year capital plans. The City\u2019s annual operating budget pays for a wide range of municipal services including fire and emergency services, roads and parks maintenance, recreation programs, waste collection and management, transit, policing, and library services. The City\u2019s capital budget funds capital maintenance and replacement of infrastructure that support municipal service delivery as well as other capital priorities as determined by City Council. Learn more about how the City develops its budget in this short video. Following three days of deliberations, the Committee of the Whole approved 2022 operating and capital budgets on Nov. 25, 2021. Operating and Capital By Laws were presented to Council on Dec. 21, 2021 for three readings. During the deliberations, Council heard from City staff and external agencies. Below, find presentations and budget overviews from City staff. For external agency presentations, please reach out to those groups directly. In 2022, The City will receive notice from the County of Frontenac confirming its 2022 budget requisition for Fairmount Home and Frontenac Paramedic Services. On Oct. 18, 2022, the City of Kingston once again received a stellar AA+ credit rating with a stable outlook from S&P Global Ratings. To find out how the City's credit rating affects our ability to borrow money or issue debentures, see the FAQs below. Explore past budgets and financial statements. In 2021, the City received a grant through the Ontario Audit & Accountability Fund Program to have an external agency review employee payroll scheduling, time and attendance processes. KPMG was selected to identify opportunities for the City to modernize and create efficiencies. The areas reviewed by KPMG included: Download the complete report. Next steps include staff developing a plan to evaluate and implement the solutions identified. Funded under the second round of the Audit and Accountability Fund Program, the City engaged KPMG to review how the Housing and Social Services Department could better integrate and digitize service for clients accessing housing, childcare, and social assistance services, as well as to identify cost savings and efficiencies. Branded as \u201cOne Focus,\u201d the project puts the client at the centre of all services and aims to create a streamlined human services system that focuses on people and provides a \u201cone window\u201d service integration approach across the department\u2019s municipally managed programs. Read the full report. The department has already started implementing some of the identified priorities, including a new vision for organizational design and the establishment of staff working groups to advance several initiatives. The following are frequently asked questions regarding the City's budgets & financials. Operating budgets outline estimates for revenues and expenditures associated with the operations of City services for the fiscal year. The approved operating budget shows what the City will spend on programs and services such as transit, garbage and recycling collection, parks, recreation programs and road maintenance. The City produces annual operating budgets as well as three year operating forecasts. The capital budget outlines the City\u2019s plans to fund/support capital assets like buses, snowplows, buildings, streets, pathways and other infrastructure that support the delivery of programs and services. Capital budgets include costs and related sources of funding to maintain, replace and refurbish these kinds of assets over their useful lives. The City maintains 15 year capital expenditure and funding models. Utilities Kingston \u2013 a separate corporation that is wholly owned by the City of Kingston \u2013 prepares budgets for the municipal utilities that it manages and operates on behalf of the City, including, water, wastewater, fibre optic and natural gas systems. These services are funded through user rates and are not supported by property taxes. Review the 2021 Utilities Kingston budget. Funds flow into the City from property taxes, user fees, and other revenue sources to be used to pay for operating costs related to the delivery of services as well as the required capital costs by transferring monies annually to the City\u2019s capital reserve funds. The capital reserve funds are then used to finance capital expenditures (investments in capital assets), either by a pay as you go method whereby funds are taken from the reserve funds to pay for the capital costs directly or through the issuance of debt whereby funds are borrowed to pay for the capital costs and the capital reserve funds are utilized to pay future debt principal and interest charges. Reserves and reserve funds are monies set aside to fund capital expenditures, similar to having personal savings accounts for anticipated needs. They are also used to manage unanticipated expenses and to support the City\u2019s long term financial stability. Based on community engagement and other resident input, Council establishes the city\u2019s strategic priorities and service levels. Departmental work plans and supporting budgets are developed to achieve these initiatives and to support the ongoing operation of City facilities, services, and programs. A collaborative approach to planning allows Council to identify and allocate resources in an affordable and sustainable manner. Budgets are developed by City staff based on Council's strategic priorities, directions, and fiscal guidelines. An annual budget engagement process provides the opportunity for the community to provide input to the budget development process. Council, sitting as Committee of the Whole, reviews and deliberates draft budget proposals as presented by City departments and external agencies and approves the final operating and capital budgets. City staff must develop a budget that addresses the demands for services and programs while, remaining mindful of the pressure on the tax rate and the broader economic environment. To meet these challenges the city\u2019s planning and budgeting process includes the following elements: The City synchronizes the planning and budgeting cycle by developing a multi year corporate strategic plan. The four year Council Strategic Plan and service level priorities are what guide decision making, policy development, and effective resource allocation over the Council term. On May 21, 2019, Council set a vision to make Kingston a smart, livable and leading city, and identified the following five strategic priorities: Improve walkability, roads, transportation Demonstrate leadership on climate crisis Strengthen economic development opportunities Increase housing affordability Foster healthy citizens and vibrant places Departmental operating plans and related operating and capital budgets are developed to support municipal services and the strategic direction set by Council and to allocate the necessary resources. The City prepares 4 year operating budgets and 15 year capital plans. These multi year forecasts allow us to recognize and understand expenditure and funding patterns, forecast expected changes over time to funding and/or services, and most importantly provide the framework for identifying and implementing longer term budgeting solutions. Financial Services and City departments monitor revenue and expenditure budget variances on a regular basis. Operating and capital budget variance reports are reviewed monthly and presented to Council on a quarterly basis. Operations are managed with the objective of having a balanced budget at year end. Regular monitoring helps to identify budget variances early on that may require management attention. To assist with infrastructure rejuvenation, the City continues to monitor and apply for grant opportunities and other sources of funding from the upper levels of government. Cities cannot and will not be able to address the increasing need for infrastructure investment on their own. Cooperation and support from federal and provincial governments is essential. The City's credit rating demonstrates the City's strength in financial management practices and positions it to secure funds on the investment market at attractive interest rates.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/fluoride/water-fluoridation-in-kingston": "Community water fluoridation in the City of Kingston was initiated in 1966 based on a direct resident vote in 1958 that supported fluoridation.

The Clogg's Road Area is identified in the City's Official Plan as a business district, intended to accommodate employment uses. The City is the primary provider of industrial land as City owned industrial/employment land accounts for a substantial portion of total industrial land absorption in Kingston. Developing the City owned portion of the Clogg\u2019s Road Area for a business park is vital to ensure a healthy, long term supply of industrial land in Kingston, thus encouraging business attraction, retention and expansion. A secondary plan is required to understand opportunities and address issues related to its future land use before moving ahead with any type of development. The Planning Services Department started the secondary plan process for the Clogg\u2019s Road Area in 2017 in order to address the required components of a secondary plan, which include a land use plan, transportation plan, servicing plan, and implementation plan. The secondary planning area map includes some existing residential homes, industrial uses, and natural environmental features, as well as a great deal of vacant land, mostly owned by the City. As the area is identified as a business district, with the City owning the majority of the lands, the primary focus will be the development of these employment lands in a way that is compatible with the existing Official Plan designation and surrounding land uses. Details about the secondary planning process were included in the information report presented to the Planning Committee in August 2018. The next steps for the project as outlined in the information report are as follows: In September 2018, the project was transferred to the City\u2019s Business, Real Estate & Environment Department who is leading the planning applications for the portion of lands owned by the City. Initially, the applications consisted of applications for zoning by law amendment and a draft plan of subdivision for the lands known as 2800 Clogg\u2019s Road (east parcel) and 3001 Clogg\u2019s Road (west parcel) as shown in the above image. A Minister\u2019s Zoning Order (MZO) was enacted on March 4, 2022, as Ontario Regulation 159/22 (O. Reg. 159/22: ZONING ORDER  CITY OF KINGSTON), the result of which has been to implement a Business Park Industrial 1 Zone and Open Space Zone on 3001 Clogg\u2019s Road and zoning on the east parcel (2800 Clogg\u2019s Road), consisting of Business Park Industrial 1 Zone, a Business Park Industrial 2 Zone and an Open Space Zone. As a result of the MZO, the scope of the proposed Business Park draft plan of subdivision has been revised to focus solely on the west parcel, 3001 Clogg\u2019s Road. A portion of the east parcel at 2800 Clogg\u2019s Road is the subject of an active application for site plan control for a new Li Cycle facility (City File: D11 022 2022). As a result of the MZO, the scope of the proposed Business Park draft plan of subdivision revised to focus solely on the west parcel, 3001 Clogg\u2019s Road. Planning Applications submitted to the City's Planning, Building & Licensing department for a third technical review in May 2022. The application was circulated on June 2, 2022. A public meeting is being held virtually on Sept.1, 2022 for the west parcel draft plan of subdivision application.

The submission includes draft plan of subdivision and various reports and studies to support the Planning Applications. Please review the submission on DASH. As part of preliminary site investigations to support a Zoning Bylaw amendment and draft plan of subdivision applications, the consultants are visiting the project site to investigate and collect information on noise, traffic, geotechnical investigations, etc. The initial phase of the consultant's work will involve a review of all background information (e.g., concept plans, community feedback summaries, Official Plan policy, Environmental Impact Assessments, etc.) and the completion of on site due diligence necessary to support preliminary draft plan of subdivision design and planning analysis.

Its form and function have changed over the years, but its basic purpose remains the same. A traditional centre of trade and commerce, the Kingston market has long provided area vendors a place to sell a range of wares and local residents easy access to foodstuffs and other goods. Springer Market Square is a rich archaeological site. Prior to its redevelopment in 2004, archaeological investigation was carried out to determine what material evidence remained of its past. Archaeological testing in 2002 and 2003 uncovered portions of an early 1800s market surface and examples of merchants' wares, stone foundations of the 1840s City Hall Market wing and massive stone steps leading to its lower level, limestone drains, the market weigh house, and water pipes for the horse fountain. We know from various historical sources that First Nation's people visited and periodically occupied the waterfront in the area where Springer Market Square is now located, but to date, no archaeological evidence of their lives has been found. The first known structures situated in the Square vicinity date from the French occupation of the area in the 1700s. Military earthworks associated with Fort Frontenac extended east to west across the centre of the Square during the period of the Seven Years War (1756 63). These simple outworks were obliterated during the early years of Loyalist settlement in the late 1700s. The Market Square was laid out as part of the original town plan in 1784 and the first market regulations published in 1811. It was the focal point for the local trade in foodstuffs and fuel, all the consumables that supported day to day life in early Kingston. It was also where the town sentinel was posted. A small wood framed T shaped picket barracks was situated approximately where the south wing of the current City Hall is situated. Another small outbuilding sat where the west wing of City Hall now stands. These military structures existed from the time of the War of 1812 until 1831 when they were auctioned off to the public and dismantled. During the first half of the 19th century, a series of temporary wooden market houses called shambles were erected for the benefit of market vendors. The shambles were extremely flimsy and either burnt or collapsed under their own weight. Kingston antiquarian Edwin Horsey described the market of 1820 \"The Market Square was not then of much account ... in the centre was the main guard house, outside of which the bands of the regiments played ...the shambles of frame had been erected for the third time...\" As early as 1834, the District Magistrates envisioned an enhanced use of the site with a combined Market House and Town Hall. In 1840 a catastrophic fire destroyed much of the downtown including the market. Two years later, Kingston Town Council selected architect George Browne's design for a combined Town Hall and Market Hall to be constructed in Market Square. Completed in 1844, the building had an Ontario Street market entrance to facilitate the unloading of goods from boats and the west wing Market Shambles extended all the way to King Street. The new market wing design included a bell tower with a clock and weathervane. In Market Square were a weigh station and a decorative fountain. Market Shambles occupants included butchers, vegetable hucksters, a print shop and a public school library. In 1865 another fire ravaged Market Square destroying the whole of the west wing. It was later rebuilt in the abbreviated form we see today. The market has continued to operate in Market Square and, over time, has evolved. The police department shifted its offices and holding cells from the basement of City Hall to the Market Wing in the early 1900s. Gradually municipal office workers replaced market vendors and merchants inside the original Shambles building. In the early 2000s, cars and trucks have replaced horses and carts, live animals are no longer available for sale and market vendors sell their wares under portable awnings instead of ramshackle shambles structures. What remains consistent is the vibrancy of trade on weekly market days during the spring, summer and autumn, when residents and tourists flock to Springer Market Square seeking fresh produce, meat and baked goods, plants and flowers, craft items and clothing, and antiques and collectibles. The Square remains alive on non market days with concerts, evening film screenings and other public events. During the winter, skaters enjoy the refrigerated ice surface installed during the 2004 redevelopment of the square.

Kingston Fire & Rescue received 342 combination smoke and carbon monoxide alarms through Safe Community Project Zero\u2013a public education campaign that will provide over 16,600 alarms to residents in 70 municipalities across Ontario. This year, Enbridge Gas invested $500,000 in Safe Community Project Zero, and over the past 13 years, the program has provided more than 68,000 alarms to Ontario fire departments. When properly installed and maintained, combination smoke and carbon monoxide alarms help provide the early warning to safely escape from a house fire or carbon monoxide exposure. Carbon monoxide is a toxic, odourless gas that is a by product of incomplete combustion of many types of common fuels. \u201cCarbon monoxide is known as the \u2018silent killer\u2019 for a reason, and we have proof that prevention saves lives.

Third party in this context is a person or entity who is not a candidate. Third party advertising is separate from any candidate's campaign and must be done independently of candidates. Candidates are not able to direct a third party advertiser. Similar to candidates, there are spending and contribution limits for third party advertisers and requirements for the submission of financial statements and auditor's reports. This section provides information about third party advertising, who can register to be a third party advertiser, what registration allows a third party advertiser to do and the rules that third party advertisers must follow. Third party advertising does not include: The following are eligible to register as a third party advertiser: The following are not eligible to register as a third party advertiser: Third party advertisers must register with the municipality where they want to advertise. If they want to advertise in more than one municipality, they must register in each municipality. Registration allows a third party advertiser to promote or oppose any candidate that the electors in the municipality can vote for (Mayor, District Councillors or school board trustees) or to support or oppose a referendum question on the ballot. Third party advertisers can register between May 2, 2022 and the close of business (4:30 p.m.) on Friday, October 21, 2022. To register, an individual, corporation or trade union must file a Notice of Registration (Form 7) with the City Clerk in person or by an agent. The form must have an original signature. The form may not be scanned and submitted electronically. There is no fee for a third party advertiser to register. An agent filing the form as a representative of a corporation or trade union should have proof that they are authorized to act on behalf of the corporation or trade union. All third party advertising signs must comply with the City's Election Signs Bylaw (2019 100). The third party advertiser is responsible for removing the signs in accordance with the provisions of the Bylaw after voting day. A summary of the Election Signs Bylaw is also provided in the Candidates section of this website. A third party advertiser must provide the following information on all of its advertisements, signs and other materials: If ads are going to be broadcast or published (e.g. on a radio station or in a newspaper), the ad must contain the information required above and the third party advertiser must also provide the broadcaster or publisher with the following information: Third party advertising is permitted until the close of voting on Voting Day. However, the Municipal Elections Act prohibits any campaign material in a voting place. The voting place includes the entire property of the building where the voting place is located including the parking lot and the adjacent streets. A third party is not permitted to have brochures, buttons, signs or any other advertising material in or adjacent to a voting place. A registered third party can only accept contributions or incur campaign expenses during their advertising campaign period. Every third party must open a bank account exclusively for the advertising campaign. The campaign period begins on the day the individual, corporation or trade union is registered as a third party advertiser and ends on January 3, 2023. If the advertising campaign has a deficit (i.e. campaign expenses exceeded the campaign contributions) the third party can apply to extend the campaign period in order to do additional fundraising (see Campaign Deficit section below). Most campaign finance rules that apply to candidates also apply to third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have spending limits and there are contribution limits for those wishing to contribute to a third party advertiser. Contributions are any money, goods or services that are given to a third party to use in the advertising campaign, including money and goods that a third party contributes to their own campaign. Contributions greater than $25 may not be made in cash. All contributions greater than $25 must be made by cheque, money order or by a method that clearly shows where the funds come from. Third parties must: A third party can accept contributions from: The following are not allowed to contribute to a third party advertising campaign: There is no limit on how much a registered third party (and, if the third party is an individual, their spouse) can contribute to their own advertising campaign. There is a $1,200 limit that applies to all other contributions from individuals, corporations or trade unions. This includes the value of any goods or services donated to the advertising campaign. The maximum total amount that a contributor can give to third parties registered in the same municipality is $5,000. Any contribution must come directly from the contributor. Campaign expenses are costs incurred during the campaign. These include costs directly related to producing, distributing or publishing advertisements, as well as indirect costs (e.g. hiring someone to keep track of contributions and issue receipts). Goods and services that are contributed to the campaign are also expenses. They should be treated as if the contributor gave the third party money and the third party went out and purchased the goods and services at fair market value \u2013 both the contribution and the expense must be recorded. Third party advertisers can only incur expenses during their advertising campaign, except for expenses related to the preparation of an auditor's report. The general spending limit for a third party advertising campaign is calculated based on the number of electors who are eligible to vote in the municipality where the third party is registered. The formula to calculate the spending limit is $5,000 plus 5 cents per eligible elector to a maximum of $25,000. There is a separate spending limit for expenses related to the holding of parties and other expressions of appreciation after the close of voting. This spending limit is calculated as 10% of the third party advertiser's general spending limit. Third parties are responsible for filing a complete and accurate Financial Statement by Friday, March 31, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. (Download the Financial Statement  Auditor\u2019s Report Third Party  Form 8). If a third party has not filed a Financial Statement by the deadline, they may file the Financial Statement within 30 days after the deadline if they pay the municipality a $500 late filing fee. The 30 day grace period ends at 2:00 p.m. on May 1, 2023. If a third party advertiser's campaign contributions or campaign expenses total more than $10,000, the third party must have an auditor review their Financial Statement and provide an Auditor's Report. A third party who extends their campaign (see Campaign Deficit below) must file their Supplementary Financial Statement by Friday, September 29, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. A third party advertiser may apply to the Superior Court of Justice to extend the time for the filing of the required Financial Statement(s). The third party advertiser must notify the City Clerk in writing of any application for a Court extension by 2:00 p.m. on the last day for filing the respective Financial Statement. If a third party advertiser has not filed a Financial Statement by the end of the 30 day grace period and did not apply for a Court extension prior to the March 31 deadline, the individual, corporation or trade union will not be eligible to register as a third party advertiser until after the 2026 municipal election. If at the end of the advertising campaign a third party's campaign contributions exceed their advertising expenses, their advertising campaign will be in a surplus. After refunding contributions made by the third party (and, if the third party is an individual, their spouse), any remaining surplus must be paid to the City Clerk when the third party files their Financial Statement. The surplus will be held in trust and can be used by the third party advertiser to cover expenses related to a compliance audit. If the surplus is not need to cover such expenses, it becomes the property of the municipality. If at the end of the advertising campaign a third party advertiser's expenses exceed their advertising contributions, their campaign will be in a deficit. The third party advertiser may apply to extend their campaign period for up to an additional six (6) months in order to do some additional fundraising. To extend the campaign period, the third party advertiser must file a Notice of Extension of Campaign Period (Download the Notice of Extension of Campaign Period \u2013 Form 6) in person with the City Clerk on or before January 3, 3023. The end date for the extended period will be the earliest of the following: Third parties that extend their advertising campaign must submit two Financial Statements by the statutory deadline dates: The Municipal Elections Act includes provisions for penalties for third party advertisers for offences related to advertising campaign finances that include fines, imprisonment, ineligibility to register as a third party advertiser for the next regular election and ineligibility to run or vote in the next regular election (in the case of conviction for bribery or other corrupt practices).", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/resident/better-homes-kingston/assessments-upgrades-retrofits/home-assessments": "Whether you are looking to reduce energy use, increase the comfort of your home, access rebates and incentives, or simply want to learn more about how your home currently uses energy, getting a home energy evaluation is always the first step. A Home Energy Evaluation is carried out by a registered NRCan Registered Energy Advisor. It is the only way to accurately determine your home\u2019s current energy efficiency and make informed decisions on how best to improve it. Participants in the Better Homes Kingston Program are also eligible for a rebate of up to $600 for your home energy evaluation, where the homeowner does not qualify for the existing NRCan Greener Homes Grant Program or Enbridge rebates. Eligible participants will receive 75 per cent of this rebate upfront, after completing their pre retrofit home energy evaluation. Home Energy Evaluations (also called Energy Audits) are carried out by Registered Energy Advisors. The evaluation includes a thorough inspection of your home to look for air leaks and drafts, gaps around doors and windows, indoor air quality, insulation levels, and HVAC equipment. A Home Energy Evaluation is the first step in the energy retrofit journey. A registered energy advisor will conduct a top to bottom evaluation of your home, inspecting your home\u2019s insulation, heating, and cooling systems, and overall home energy use to detect sources of energy loss. When the evaluation is complete, you will receive: Before booking your Home Energy Evaluation make sure that your home is eligible for evaluation. To be eligible make sure that: Generally, evaluations will take 2.5 3 hours. It\u2019s required that the legal homeowner be present for the duration of the evaluation. During your in house visit, a Registered Energy Advisor will evaluate different areas of your home, from insulation to heating and cooling systems. They will also conduct a blower door test, to assess your home\u2019s air leakage. Following your in house visit, you can expect to receive your Energy Audit Reports within approximately 2 weeks. This will outline several tiered recommendations to help you improve your energy efficiency. All recommendations are fully customized to your home and lifestyle, to help you navigate your next steps. A blower door test is a way to find (and fix) air leaks in your home\u2019s building envelope. All windows and doors must be properly closed, then your home is depressurized using a large fan built into a shield that is placed in one open doorway. This powerful exhaust fan draws air in from any existing hole in your air barrier no matter how small it is. If you are eligible for an incentive program, the program may refund, in full or in part, the cost of your energy evaluations. To qualify for available rebates and incentives, you will need to get a home energy evaluation before and after your renovation. Check out the Better Homes Kingston Program, and contact us to learn more about how you can get help to apply for multiple programs to maximize your energy saving and incentives/rebates before starting your renovation. Starting work in the home before your home energy evaluation may disqualify you from available rebates and incentives.

See the Projects & Programs page for a list of new cycling infrastructure projects now underway. Bike lanes are installed on moderately busy roadways with moderate speeds. Bike lanes provide cyclists with designated space, which is identified by pavement markings and signage. Bikes lanes could painted green along key corridors. When approaching intersections, division lines become dotted to allow for passing. Buffered bike lanes are installed on roads with higher traffic volumes and speed within the urban and suburban areas of a city. A 0.5m buffer is added to the existing 1.5m wide bike lane with or without collapsible bollards. This provides additional separation between cyclists and motor vehicles. Bike boxes are green painted designated areas at signalized intersections that allow cyclists to move ahead of traffic into a safe and visible location when the traffic lights are red. Vehicles are required to stop behind the green bike box, and are not able to make right hand turns on red at intersections where bike boxes are present. During green lights, intersections with bike boxes are treated as normal roadways. Cyclists have priority through the intersection when the light turns green. Bike boxes significantly increase the visibility of cyclists, making motorists more aware of their presence. They are designed to make it easier and safer for a cyclist waiting at an intersection to make a left turn, rather than having to weave through traffic while trying to signal. Bike boxes also help to prevent drivers from making right turns in front of cyclists approaching from behind This brief video below explains how to use bike boxes. Crossrides are cycling facilities that work like crosswalks do for pedestrians. They allow cyclists to remain on their bikes and safely cross through an intersection. Crossrides are identified by thick, painted blocks on either side and white painted bicycle symbols with directional arrows. They may also include green paint. Crossrides are commonly located next to pedestrian crosswalks and often have their own dedicated signal that lets cyclists know when they may enter the intersection. At smaller, unsignalized crossings, \u201cmixed\u201d cross rides may be in the form of a shared bicycle and pedestrian crosswalk. This brief video explains how crossrides work: Cycle tracks are a separate space found between the motor vehicle lane and curb. Cycle tracks are appropriate on roads with high speeds and volumes. They can be bi or uni directional. Cycle tracks are 1.5m wide if unidirectional and 3m if bi directional. Motorists and cyclists share the same vehicular travel lane on a signed bike route. Bicycle route signs are used to provide route guidance for cyclists and, at times, can be supplemented with share the road signs in areas of poor visibility. Signed bike routes are used on low volume, low speed roadways, such as residential streets. Paved shoulders provide a designated space on the road platform. Bicycle route signs are used to provide route guidance for cyclists and, at times, can be supplemented with share the road signs in areas of poor visibility. Paved shoulders are used on moderately busy roads with moderate speeds. Buffered paved shoulders are installed on roads with high volume and speed in rural areas of a city. A 0.5m buffer is added to the existing shoulder with the shoulder width dependent on speed and volume of the roadway. This provides additional separation between cyclists and motor vehicles. Buffered paved shoulders are signed as bicycle routes. Off road trails are separated spaces, typically through a natural area or corridor, that accommodate pedestrians and cyclists. The surface type can range from natural surface to asphalt depending on the location. Both portions of the Waterfront Trail and the K&P Trail are examples of off road trails. In boulevard trails are a separated space found within the boulevard of the roadway \u2013 in place of a sidewalk, which accommodates both pedestrians and cyclists in a shared space. In boulevard trails can be either uni or bi directional. The Bath Road Bikeway, completed in fall 2018, is an example of an in boulevard trail in Kingston", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/explore/active-transportation/cyclists/bike-locking": "Registering your bike and ensuring that it is locked properly are the best ways to prevent your bike from being stolen. See the video below for some tips on how to lock your bicycle: Always use a secure, high quality bike lock, such as a u lock. High security locks require more time to defeat in comparison to chains or cable locks, which can often be defeated by bike thieves in seconds. Consult with your local bike shop for help in choosing a lock and how to use it effectively. Whenever possible, store your bicycle inside or in a locked garage. Avoid locking your bike on the front porch or at the side of the house/building. Residents living in high rise apartments and condominiums should store their bike in a designated secured enclosure if available. When locking your bike outside, lock the frame and at least one wheel to a secure bike rack, such as an inverted u or post and ring rack. If possible, secure the second wheel by using a high quality cable lock. Avoid using bike racks that are damaged or not properly anchored. Avoid locking to objects that can be moved, dismantled, or destroyed to free your bike  such as street signs, fences, and even small trees. Public bike racks located on sidewalks or in front of businesses are generally safe for short term daytime parking. Avoid locking your bike in concealed areas with poor lighting and little to no surveillance opportunities. The more visible your bike is, the less likely is it will be targeted for theft. Even if your bike is locked securely, accessories and bike parts are often targeted by thieves. Be sure to take your helmet and easily removed accessories with you \u2013 such as lights, water bottles, bells, and gear bags. For added security, swap quick release parts (such as seat posts and wheel axles) with bolts or secure hardware. Ask the experts at your local bike shop if you need any help. When buying a used bike, meet in a public place and verify that the serial number isn\u2019t listed as missing/stolen on 529 Garage. When selling a bike that you\u2019ve registered, don\u2019t forget to transfer the registration to the new owner on 529 Garage. No personal information will be shared. Even a properly locked bike can be stolen with enough time and effort. The City has partnered with Kingston Police and Cycle Kingston to provide a bicycle registration service through 529 Garage. Registering your bike through 529 Garage increases the likelihood your bike will be found and returned to you by police or others in the community. Bikes bearing the 529 Shield also warn thieves that it is registered, acting as an additional deterrent to theft. Registering is quick and easy \u2013 just download the 529 Garage app from your smartphone or tablet, or head to the 529 Garage website. Enter the important information about your bike, including serial number, brand, and colour. Add photos of your bike too  the more information you provide the easier your bike will be to identify. Shield your bike \u2013 The tamper resistant 529 Shield acts as an additional deterrent, warning would be thieves that your bike is registered. The shield also makes it easier to find your bike if it is recovered. You can pick up a shield at Kingston Police Headquarters, or purchase one through Cycle Kingston or a participating bicycle shop. If your bike goes missing, it\u2019s easy to report it as stolen or missing using 529 Garage app or website. 529 Garage will send out an alert to the community so that others can keep an eye out and notify you if your bike is found. Once you\u2019ve marked a bike as missing or stolen, 529 Garage will direct you to Kingston Police\u2019s online reporting page. Filing a police report is a requirement to legally claim your bike back if it is recovered by any Police department in Canada. There is no cost to report your bike as stolen to Kingston Police. The serial number is often engraved or embedded into the frame, though it may also be printed on a sticker affixed to your bike. Look carefully! Most bicycle serial numbers are located under the bottom bracket where the two pedal cranks come together. Simply turn your bike upside down and record the number.

Review the list below to learn about the current tree pests and diseases in Kingston. On this page: The Spongy Moth  previously referred to as Lymantria Dispar Dispar or Gypsy Moth \u2013 is a non native species that originated in Europe. The first detection of this invasive caterpillar in Ontario was found in 1969, while extensive defoliation (where leaves have been eaten) did not happen until 1981. This invasive pest defoliates trees, prevents new growth, and stresses trees, making them more susceptible to damage from secondary pests, drought, and poor growing conditions. Spongy Moth outbreaks happen in cycles, often occurring every seven to 10 years, with outbreaks lasting three to five years. As a food source, Spongy Moths prefer oaks, but the moths will lay eggs on, and the caterpillars will eat, a variety of both Deciduous and coniferous trees. When the caterpillars hatch in the spring, they will climb upwards in search of leaves. Left untouched, a tree can be defoliated as one single caterpillar will eat in the range of 1 square meter of foliage in its life cycle. A single or double year of defoliation will not likely kill a deciduous tree (broadleaf) on its, the contribution of draught additional pests and diseases can cause enough stress to impact leaf production the following year. Multiple years of defoliation can cause long term health effects to an individual or stand of trees. However, a healthy tree will produce a second flush of leaves in the same year it has been defoliated. You can assist your tree by ensuring it is watered during periods of drought during the peak times of defoliation to ensure stored resources are not depleted. Coniferous trees are not a preferred species of the Spongy Moth but when preferred resources are depleted, or during peak infestations, they will be infested. Once defoliated they will not recover, by growing new needles. Typically, you notice stripped branches starting at the base of the tree progressing upward. Currently, the City of Kingston is doing moth density surveys at 20 separate locations within the city\u2019s urban boundary. This information will help us determine population spikes throughout the city and assist in determining management strategies. We will not be aerial spraying at this time. Natural predators and pathogens are curbing the outbreak of Spongy moth in North America. Follow the steps below to help protect your trees from the invasive Spongy moth caterpillar. The egg mass is a fuzzy tan/beige coloured flattened blob, about 2 to 2.5 cm (3/4 of an inch) wide and slightly longer. The egg mass will have dark brown spots \u2013 known as pupae and they too should be removed if you find them \u2013 at this time of year, they are probably empty. These masses should be removed and destroyed to prevent and control population growth; as each egg mass can hold 100 1000 eggs. Why wait until the fall to remove the egg masses? Beginning now and into August and September, look for \u201cpinholes\u201d on the egg masses, evidence that they have been parasitized by a tiny, non stinging wasp. If you can, wait to remove or destroy egg masses until after leaf fall or the first hard frost to allow this beneficial wasp an opportunity to build up its numbers. To remove the egg masses: Do not use a pressure washer, a hose, or spray bottle to remove the eggs, this will cause dispersion and the eggs will likely survive. During the early spring (late April \u2013 May) when conditions allow, eggs hatch and larvae spread in search of trees to feed on foliage (leaves). At this state, you will see holes centred in the leaf. At the beginning of the life cycles, feeding occurs during the day, however, as a caterpillar matures feeding can occur overnight when temperatures are cooler. One will find them feeding on the edges of the leaf and will find more Spongy Moth caterpillars in the lower parts of a tree during the day when temps are high which makes it easier to handpick. Caterpillar larvae will emerge from the egg masses during this time. They will begin looking for food, these tiny caterpillars will find a tree and crawl up to the canopy to begin feeding. You may see caterpillars hanging from silk lines dangling from trees or other hard surfaces, they do this as a mode of \u2018transportation\u2019, taking advantage of the wind to be moved from tree to tree and may fall to the ground during this time. Tape can be applied to the tree trunk to prevent caterpillars from reaching the top. If you are able to, in mid May when the caterpillars are still small and vigorously eating is the ideal time to apply insecticides that include the bacterial compound BTk (Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki) which occurs naturally in soils. Btk is very specific and only activates in insect stomachs with low/no acid (alkaline environments). It produces a toxic protein that breaks down stomach walls. The insect usually dies within two to five days. Facts about Btk: Feeding typically is completed by mid July Once the caterpillars are established actively eating and larger in size, they will move down the tree trunk to seek shelter from heat and predators. Placing burlap around the tree trunk will entice caterpillars to rest there. These caterpillars can then be easily removed and destroyed. Notes about burlap: Aphids \u2013 the most common species in Kingston are small and green in colour with long antennas. They attack by sucking the sucrose from the leaves of Little Leaf Lindens and Honey Locust species. They excrete a sticky \u201choneydew\u201d oil like substance, which can cause the plant to develop a black sooty mold, making the leaves appear dirty and grey. They can be found on the underside of the leaves of affected trees. Eastern Tent Caterpillar  similar periodic life cycles to the Forest Tent Caterpillar, active through June and July. This caterpillar forms tent like webs on branch tips and corners of tree limbs. Primary hosts include the Apple and Cherrie species. They are hairy with a brownish black colouring and light streak down the back with lines along their body that are brown yellow lines with blue spots. Adult moths are usually reddish brown in colour. Emerald Ash Borer (EAB)  the most destructive tree pest currently active in Ontario. It affects all Ash trees except for the Mountain Ash. Larvae feed on the inner bark and outer sapwood, forming \u2018s shaped\u2019 galleries that are white in colour. Adult beetles are metallic green in color and form D shape exit holes in the bark when they emerge in the spring. European Gypsy Moth  active from April to June and feed on both coniferous and deciduous species. Moths are charcoal grey colour and have a double row of six red dots on the back. Single larvae can eat in excess of 1 square meter of foliage in a season. Fall Web Worms \u2013 active from mid August through September, this insect forms a large nest up to one metre long at the ends of branches, wrapping around the branches of Ash, Manitoba Maples, and Crabapple species. The webworm is pale yellow and very hairy. Adults are white moths with a wingspan of from 30 to 42 millimetres. Infestations are non fatal for trees, but aesthetically displeasing. Forest Tent Caterpillar  periodic pest; populations can last from 3 6 years on 10 12 year cycles. Heavy defoliators in southern Ontario, their primary hosts are Sugar Maple and Red Oak. The caterpillar creates silk mats on trunks and branches where they collect. They are hairy and brown in colour, with a slate blue stripe along each side and a row of keyhole shaped white spots along the back. Adults are buff brown moths with three darker bands across each forewing. Anthracnose \u2013affects Maple, Ash, and Oak species in the early spring when the weather is cool and damp. Hot, dry summers will stop the progression of symptoms. An early browning and/or drying of leaves will occur with the potential for some leaf drop. Small brown dots on the underside of leaves are also likely to occur. Dutch Elm Disease \u2013has been active in Ontario since 1946 and affects several elm species, spread primarily by beetles. Symptoms present in newly infected trees during early June and are fatal to the tree within three years. Maple Tar Spot \u2013 forms black blotches on Maple leaves and may cause early leaf drop. It is a non fatal disease, but aesthetically displeasing. Ensuring leaves are cleaned up as they drop in the fall can break the cycle of this disease.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/parking": "The City provides municipal parking to help retain and enhance the viability of the city core, through support of local businesses, institutions, tourism and community wide participation in social and cultural activities.

The system then compresses the refrigerant and condenses it from a vapour to a liquid, releasing the heat so that the cooled/liquid refrigerant can be expanded and sent back into the home, where it starts the cycle again. There are two types of central air conditioner systems to choose from: $2,400 to more than $6,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Room air conditioners, also known as, window air conditioners, cool individual rooms rather than your entire home. These air conditioners are less expensive to operate than central air conditioners because they only provide cooling in areas that are needed. They are also a good option for residents in high rise buildings without central air conditioning. $200 to $600 Source: Natural Resources Canada Space and water heating are the biggest users of energy in Canadian homes which accounts for approximately 80per cent of residential energy consumption and 99per cent of GHG emissions in Ontario residences Boilers use gas or oil to provide space heating and hot water to your home. Boilers distribute heat using radiators or in floor radiant heating, eliminating the need for pre existing duct systems. Gas and oil boilers are subject to Canada\u2019s Energy Efficiency Regulations, which sets minimum performance standards for their energy efficiency. All boilers sold in Canada are energy efficient. Check the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) rating, the minimum should be between 82 and 84 per cent. Replacing your oil boiler? Consider switching to a natural gas boiler which tends to produce less waste and fewer harmful emissions. $3,000 to $8,000 Source: Natural Resources Canada If your house, or a room, has moist or wet stains on a wall or ceiling, musty odours, windows or pipes that are covered with condensation, and/or feels stuffy, you may need a dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers regulate the humidity in a room by removing excess moisture from the air, thereby creating a living condition that is inhospitable to dust mites, mould and other allergenic organisms. They run quietly and efficiently in the background without most people even noticing. There are two types of dehumidifiers available, portable and whole house. For significant, year round issues of high humidity, get a whole house dehumidifier that uses your home\u2019s heating and cooling system to reduce the humidity throughout your entire house. If the humidity is periodic or confined to one room, a portable unit is sufficient. Whole house units $1,000 \u2013 $2,000+; portable units $150 \u2013 $300.

Drain water heat recovery systems capture the heat from water going down a drain, typically the shower, and use it to heat cold water entering your water heater. It\u2019s particularly effective when there are simultaneous water flows i.e. when you\u2019re using hot water in the shower at the same time that water is flowing down the drain. $550 \u2013 $1,700 plus installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada A furnace uses ductwork and vents to distribute warm air throughout your house. High efficiency gas furnaces are quiet, reliable, and effective at maintaining a comfortable home, and they can reduce your energy bill by up to 45 per cent. An ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified forced air furnace, fueled by gas uses 6 per cent less energy, fueled by oil uses 9 per cent less energy, on average than a standard model. Space heating represents more than half of your home\u2019s energy use and offers the most potential for reducing your energy bill. If your furnace was installed before 1990, it\u2019s probably a lower efficiency model, as regulations for furnaces in Canada have been updated since then. If you upgrade to an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified furnace, you will save money and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases you emit. $2,000 \u2013 $8,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Space heating accounts for 60per cent of the energy used in the average Canadian home. For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation.

A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air. Choose an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ductless heating and cooling system to cut your electrical heating bill by up to 60 per cent, and your cooling bill by 30 per cent, depending on your climate. $2,500 to $5,000+ per unit, including installation.

If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures. Ground source heating produce less CO2 than other forms of space heating systems. $20,000 \u2013 $40,000, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Homes built after 1977 are typically more airtight, which helps to prevent heat loss but also prevents air circulation, which is important for your health and comfort. Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems.

Water heaters with storage tanks are the most common in Canadian homes, but they are not the most energy efficient. Electricity, gas or oil is used to heat water stored in the tank and supply it, as needed, to household fixtures and appliances. Storage tanks typically hold between 113 and 378 litres of water in their tanks, and this water is continuously reheated and kept hot 24 hours a day. $800 to $1,500, plus installation.

Tankless water heaters heat water as it flows, and only when required, using an electric element or gas burner. They provide endless hot water and the heat on demand feature means you only pay to heat water as you use it, instead of paying to keep a tank of water heated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. $1,000 to $2,800 Source: Natural Resources Canada", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/community-services/fr/childcare": "La garde d'enfants joue un r\u00f4le cl\u00e9, puisqu'elle contribue \u00e0 favoriser le d\u00e9veloppement sain des enfants et qu'elle aide les parents \u00e0 concilier leur vie professionnelle et leur vie familiale pendant qu'ils participent au march\u00e9 du travail, ou qu'ils poursuivent des \u00e9tudes ou de la formation.

Brent Toderian is a city planning consultant with TODERIAN UrbanWORKS, an ongoing advisor to the City of Kingston on city planning and transportation since 2018, and the co author of The Power of Parking with the City\u2019s Planning Services staff. What if we told you that here in Kingston, over the last few months, we\u2019ve started one of the most important city planning conversations we\u2019ve ever had? You might think we\u2019re exaggerating, but we\u2019re really not. That conversation is about parking \u2013 parking regulations in our zoning by law, to be exact  and although that kind of conversation in cities is usually really, REALLY boring, there are few elements of city building that are more important to achieving our stated goals than how we do parking. Goals like climate change mitigation, releasing less pollution and fewer emissions, improved affordability, more viable heritage and affordable housing projects, reduced public costs and taxes, and much more. That\u2019s why we decided to call this conversation, and the Planning Department document that launched it, \u201cThe Power of Parking!\u201d We really wanted everyone to understand that power and really \u201cconnect the dots,\u201d maybe for the first time, between how we do parking and all those big public goals and aspirations of Council and our community. The first chapter of the document does just that connect those dots in a way that we\u2019ve never seen before in a Canadian city hall parking report. We really hope you\u2019ll read it. Deliberately written in a bold, provocative and accessible way, the document starts with a hard hitting preamble that, among other things, comes clean about the REAL \u201cparking problem\u201d \u2014 not that there\u2019s too little parking  but rather that there\u2019s more likely too much! It shares candidly the many huge costs and consequences of over building parking, from affordability and economic costs (that we ALL pay), to big climate change costs, and how public design (and public life) too often suffers. In creating \u2018The Power of Parking,\u2019 it was really important for us to realistically recognize the \u2018moment\u2019 Kingston is in as a city, while not losing sight of the City\u2019s ambitious aspirations. These became important \u2018gut check\u2019 conversations among our team and with the community to ensure that the development of new parking provisions was \u2018right sized\u2019 for Kingston; a mix of realism, with aspirational and transformational thinking. While Kingston has an excellent transit system and is building out a multi year active transportation network, at present there are still under serviced areas of the city in terms of transportation alternatives, including an expansive rural area and more suburban areas within the eastern and western portions of the city. The result is not only an evolving new parking strategy that\u2019s deliberately and unapologetically \u201cMade in Kingston,\u201d but also an approach that rejects \u201cone size fits all\u201d thinking by recognizing that Kingston\u2019s downtown and central area is contextually very different than its suburbs, which are very contextually different than its rural areas. We also worked hard to proactively anticipate and address the kinds of details and nuances that our community members would be concerned with \u2013 for example, how to make sure that with less parking there won\u2019t be less accessible parking. In addition to reviewing literally hundreds of parking studies within Kingston and across dozens of Ontario municipalities, staff deliberatively took the time to consult the development industry and municipal colleagues in other cities, in addition to engaging many stakeholders and residents to ensure that the potential implications of new parking provisions is fully understood. A big shout out of thanks to staff from the City of Edmonton, City of Vancouver and the Clean Air Partnership for their insights and for their willingness to share their knowledge and lessons learned from their own experiences. Although such cities are very different than Kingston, we are still able to learn and benefit from their successes, failures and debates. Here\u2019s a taste of the innovation we\u2019re working on and have included in our second draft of the new zoning by law. Significantly reduced parking minimums and new incentives: Possibly the most interesting part of our new conversation has been deciding whether to recommend getting rid of parking minimums all together or do something potentially even more strategic. Although our thinking has been inspired by the growing number of cities that have recently removed their parking minimums, ultimately Staff is leaning toward reducing and simplifying the minimums in every land use category, plus including the ability to build even less parking through cash in lieu and/or incentives that would be strategically directed to the creation of car share service within residential buildings. Car share is seen as a key strategic puzzle piece in moving Kingston from a city where cars may be used less but are still owned, to a city where fewer cars are owned and thus less parking is needed. The goal will be to illustrate that car share isn\u2019t just a big city idea \u2013 it can work in cities like Kingston if the strategy is smart and the commitment is strong. Using lower parking requirements to support successful car share makes sense, since car share has been demonstrated to reduce the need for parking. So as simple as \u201cno more parking minimums\u201d sounds, Kingston is opting for a combined approach that seeks to achieve even more. The two exceptions are affordable housing projects, which would have no parking minimums except for accessible parking and residential visitor parking, and heritage projects, which will have no minimum parking requirements at all. New Parking MAXIMUMS: Given that it\u2019s important to recognize that reducing parking minimums doesn\u2019t actually ensure less parking is constructed and doesn\u2019t prevent over building of parking with all its many consequences, possibly the most important change we\u2019ve been considering is the creation of strategic residential parking maximums. The maximum numbers being considered are contextual and ambitious, with an interesting detail that Kingston might be the first city to try \u2013 we\u2019re considering an incentive that would allow developers to build slightly more than the maximum in return for building the parking to be electric vehicle ready and for providing additional car share spaces on site. So there would be incentive opportunities if a builder wanted to build less parking than the reduced minimum, or slightly more parking than the newly established maximum, with all such incentives directed to making alternatives to car ownership more attractive. Alternatives to Motor Vehicles: Our new parking proposals include many creative regulations and incentives to make biking, transit and walking more attractive alternatives, at the same time as parking is reduced. These include the previously mentioned strategies for successful car share, plus better ways to tie lower parking to better public transit service levels; requirements for more and better bike parking; new ways to achieve more secure bike parking inside and outside buildings to prevent bike theft (which we know is a major barrier for people to see bike use as an alternative to car use and ownership); new mandated bike parking for e bikes and larger bikes (cargo bikes, carriers, accessible bikes etc); change and maintenance facilities; and more. Our new zoning by law is heading toward a Council decision early in 2022. It\u2019s important to remember that everything we\u2019re talking about thus far are merely recommendations currently, for Council to ultimately decide on. What\u2019s already clear though, is that the new parking conversation in Kingston is already changing things. Once the dots have been connected between the values and goals that our city believes in, and a really powerful detail like parking, they aren\u2019t easily disconnected. The Power of Parking is already becoming Kingston\u2019s game changing \u2018call to action\u2019 for a much better business as usual. That\u2019s why we consider it to be one of the most important city planning conversations we\u2019ve ever had. We hope you\u2019ll read the document (again, it was written to be readable!) and get involved by adding your own voice.

The study was last updated in 2013. The study projections are reflected in the City's Official Plan and have been used to inform other strategic planning documents such as the Water and Wastewater Master Plan, the Kingston Transportation Master Plan, the Active Transportation Master Plan, the Employment Land Strategy Review, the Commercial Land Review, and the Kingston Transit Five Year Business Plan 2017 2021. This study is particularly significant as the projections made in 2013 were substantially higher that experienced in the City as reported by Statistic's Canada's 2016 Census. As a result, this iteration of projections for the City of Kingston and Kingston CMA will include a thorough analysis as to why the 2016 Census data is at such odds with the 2013 projections. A component of the study also includes an analysis of the City's rental market, which will identify trends and future change and supply requirements in the market, both primary (i.e. apartment rentals) and secondary (i.e. private dwelling rentals). Evaluating employment trends and providing insight into key employment sectors is also to be addressed in the study. Public and stakeholder consultation is an important component of the study update.

Engine 1095 has provided a favourite photo op for residents and tourists visiting Confederation Park for more than 40 years. It is a reminder that Confederation Park was once an active train yard, that the Visitor Information Centre was once the Kingston & Pembroke Railway station and that Kingston was once home to the Canadian Locomotive Company for over 100 years. That company built more than 3,000 steam, electric and diesel engines for the Canadian Pacific Railway, including Engine 1095. The presence of Engine 1095 in Kingston provides a crucial link to the City's industrial past having been built by the Canadian Locomotive Company Ltd. (CLC), formerly located on the Kingston waterfront. For over a century the CLC was a major supplier of locomotives to the CPR, delivering nearly one third of its fleet over a number of decades and making it Canada's second largest commercial builder at the time. Engine 1095 first made its debut in 1913 and was put into service out of Winnipeg and then Southern Ontario before completing its service life in Montreal in 1960. As a symbol of 19th century technology and industry, the continuing existence of Engine 1095 points to a significant period in Kingston and Canada's history that demands to be preserved and maintained. It also helps to illustrate a significant aspect of Kingston's history by positioning it as an important industrial and political hub. Engine 1095 was fully restored in 2013, 100 years after it was first built. This project was initiated in 2007 by a group of dedicated volunteers known as \u2018The 1095 Restoration Volunteer Group'. At the time they submitted a survey of findings and recommendations to Kingston City Council raising their concerns about Engine 1095's deteriorating condition. They offered an overall assessment of the locomotive and made a case for its restoration along with a proposed course of action. This initial request, followed by additional research and investigation by City staff, resulted in City Council's decision to proceed with the restoration of the locomotive that began in 2011 and was completed in 2013 to coincide with the locomotive's centenary. The restoration of Engine 1095 was made possible by a unique partnership between the City of Kingston and Local 221, the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada. Local 221, established in Kingston in 1900, is a multi craft union whose members are engaged in the fabrication, installation and servicing of piping systems. Their enthusiasm for this project ensured it was completed with a combination of expertise and passion. A number of associated unions and industry partners also got involved helping to ensure the skills available matched the complexity of the project.

Give a reasonable time frame that you would expect the deficiencies to be corrected. Please select a heading from the following menu for further information: Although a letter notifying your landlord would be the best way to reinforce our actions, your notification to the landlord by phone is accepted. Contact us if the landlord fails to correct problems at 613 546 4291, extension 3280. You can visit the Property Standards office at 1211 John Counter Blvd. anytime between 8:30  4:30 p.m. The tenant will be contacted by a Property Standards Inspector to arrange a suitable time for an inspection to confirm the deficiencies when there is no indication the problem is being corrected. This will be done within two weeks of receipt of your notice to us. After the inspector confirms the deficiencies, an Order will be sent to the owner or agent listing deficiencies to be repaired within a prescribed time. An inspection will be made after the compliance date to confirm if the repairs have been done, if complete the file is closed. Where the owner fails to resolve the deficiencies in the Order and does not appeal the Order, the Order becomes final and binding. The City may then commence Legal action. An owner may appeal the order issued by the Property Standards Office and by sending a Notice of Appeal to the Property Standards Committee, c/o the City Clerk's Office within 14 days after being served with the Order. The Property Standards Committee may rescind, modify or confirm the Order and may extend the time to do the work. Once an Order is final and binding and where there is no attempt to correct the deficiencies, the City may take legal action against a property owner. Charges may be laid under the Building Code Act. The fines under the Building Code Act are a maximum of $25,000 for an individual for the first offence, and a maximum of $50,000 for each subsequent offence. The fines for a corporation are a maximum of $50,000 for the first offence and a maximum of $100,000 on subsequent offences. In many cases tenants are able to resolve problems with the landlord without the City's help. In cases where the problems are not resolved, the City will intervene to have violations corrected. Note: It is the tenants responsibility to follow up on the status of the deficiencies reported.

Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A backwater valve, also called a backflow valve, is a device used to prevent outbound water in a home\u2019s drain pipes from re entering, or \u201cbackflowing\u201d\u2014into your home. The valve has a flap that allows water to leave but closes to prevent water and/or sewage from entering. Backwater valves are designed to close the sewer line during periods of extreme rain to prevent water from entering your home. When the valve is closed you should not use any plumbing fixtures (i.e. toilets, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines) because water will not drain and will back up into your home. The Insurance Bureau of Canada recommends residents not install the plug type valves, as they allow sewer backup pressure to build beneath your basement floor, which may cause structural damage to your home. $500 to $2,000 including installation. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. Early detection of water leakage can help you quickly determine the cause and source of the leak and address it before flooding occurs. Flood alarms, also known as, flood detectors, water alarms or water detectors are electronic devices that detect the presence of water and set off an alarm when its sensors are triggered. Flood alarms come in different shapes and sizes and with a wide range of features. New models have WiFi capabilities with smart home integration. $25 to $150 Cool roofs reflect the sun\u2019s rays and reduce heat build up through a light coloured or highly reflective roofing product such as a coating, new membrane or shingle. Most roofs in Canada are dark in colour and absorb heat from the sun\u2019s rays transferring it into the rooms below. Because cool roofs are better at reflecting the sun\u2019s energy, less heat is transferred inside your home. As a result, you may not have to use your air conditioner as much, saving you energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cool roofs also increase the life expectancy of your roof, because they reflect the heat and UV rays that damage and age roof materials. Dark coloured roofs in high density areas also contribute to the urban heat island effect \u2013 significantly warmer temperatures in urban areas compared to rural areas. As a result of climate change, Kingston is expected to see dramatic increases in the number of extremely hot days due to continued global warming. Installing a cool roof is one way to help to offset this. There are cool roof options for all types of roofs, including steep slope (pitched roofs), low slope (flat roofs).. Roofing products are tested for their reflectivity and given a Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value between 0 100. The higher the number, the more reflective it is. If you want to convert an existing roof into a cool roof, you have the following options: Green roofs are living roofs. They support the growth of vegetation and consist of a waterproofing membrane, drainage layer, organic growing medium (soil), and vegetation. Green roofs capture stormwater, improve air quality and create habitats for pollinators, birds and other wildlife. Green roofs also help insulate your home in the summer and help reduce the overall temperature in Kingston. Green roof systems are generally classified as extensive, semi intensive or intensive. Your budget, vision and the structural capacity of your building will determine which type of green roof you select. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A sump pump is a small pump that is installed at the lowest part of your basement or crawlspace that prevents flooding. The sump is the low space that collects liquids, while the sump pump detects water in the sump and moves it away from your home through a network of pipes that is dug into the floor of the basement. Groundwater can easily rise through the cracks in your foundation during long periods of rain. If there is a possibility that flooding can occur in your basement or crawl space, a sump pump will collect all of this water and redirect it away from your home. There are two types of primary sump pumps available: submersible and pedestal pumps. Submersible pumps have the motor placed underwater in your sump basin, while pedestal pumps are positioned with the pump motor out of the water, above your sump basin. It is recommended that Kingston residents consider a submersible sump pump as they are the quietest, most powerful and effective sump pump. They also allow for an airtight lid that will stop debris from falling into the pit and prevent moisture and odorous air from being released into your home. $700 to $5,000, including installation.

City Hall also housed Kingston's original police headquarters. Opened in 1844, the design of the police department included working spaces for the constables and several cramped, dark basement cells to hold men, women and children arrested on suspicion of an array of crimes. These holding cells remained in regular use until 1906 and survive today as material evidence of nineteenth century policing technique. The cells are currently the focus of a project to restore the spaces and use them to interpret the historical experience of ordinary Kingstonians and their encounters with social hardship, crime and the criminal justice system. The 175th anniversary of the Kingston Police was marked in 2016. Recent renovations preserve and restore the original City Hall police holding cells, in use from 1844 to 1906. Adaptation of the areas around the lockup provide historical context through an accessible modern gallery showcasing some of the heritage collection belonging to the Kingston Police.

The goal was to identify a system of natural features and areas, including wetlands, woodlands and significant wildlife areas. The study area included all urban and rural lands located within the municipal boundaries of the two municipalities. The findings have been used to update official plan policies for the City and Loyalist Township. The Natural Heritage Study was intended to The Natural Heritage Study is a good news story. Unlike many areas of southern Ontario, there are extensive, relatively healthy natural communities still intact in this geographic area. This is good for the local community because it not only provides a healthy environment in which to live and helps protect precious water resources, but also is an attraction for tourism and related economic benefits. An array of natural heritage features allows for recreational activities such as hiking and walking. Natural stream corridors and hedgerows link the larger landscape features (wetlands, ravines, forests, and grasslands) to form a connected web of landforms and habitats that are home to a diverse wildlife community. The Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) outlines the Province's interests in land use and development. These policies must be reflected in local planning documents, such as the Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw. The PPS requires planning authorities to protect significant natural heritage features and areas by restricting development and site alteration, and by demonstrating that the features and ecological function of the areas will not be harmed. This is normally done through the preparation of an environmental impact assessment by a qualified individual. Examples of natural features and areas include: wetlands, fish habitat, woodlands, valleylands, habitat of endangered species and threatened species, and areas of natural and scientific interest. The study recommendations are an important component of the new Official Plan for the City. The first step was to gather and map existing information about natural heritage features and areas. A set of criteria was developed, and applied to the data collected, to assess the significance of the features and areas. The study involved extensive analysis of air photo imagery. Recommendations were developed for land use planning and stewardship activities to maintain and enhance the Central Cataraqui Region natural heritage system. Public consultation sessions were held to discuss the draft policy and the mapping for the study. This project will help both municipalities to make informed decisions on development proposals in or adjacent to natural heritage features in their jurisdictions. Also, the project is not just about land use planning. Stewardship, education, and restoration of impaired habitats are also important components. In 2006, City Council accepted the report in fulfilment of the Terms of Reference, and in 2008, Council further endorsed the study recommendations for incorporation in the new Official Plan.

The on street parking program discourages all day parkers from overcrowding residential streets in a high demand neighbourhood. A large number of commuters can take up on street spots all day on streets that do not have time of day restrictions. These users are typically commuters who work in the vicinity of an institution or a business where parking is in high demand. This creates parking challenges for area residents and their short term visitors' parking needs. The on street program is designed to address these concerns. The on street program has two components: The program frees up on street spots for those in need of short term parking, primarily residents and visitors. It also offers some controlled parking for commuters, if parking in off street lots is not available. No. The City is not proposing changes of this nature. No. Residents are not required to purchase a permit if they can work within the regulations that typically restrict parking for one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon on weekdays. Parking on the street in the early morning, late afternoon, evening, and overnight (April 1 to November 30) or anytime on the weekends does not require a permit. A permit is available for residents who wish to be exempted from the morning and afternoon week day time of use restrictions. The rate in effect is $25 a month (taxes included). Residents that do not have a driveway or on site parking space will be eligible for a $12 a month on street permit. Commuter permits range from $91.25 to $136.75 depending on the proximity to institutions and businesses with high parking demands (commuter permits for areas closest to these institutions will be more expensive). These rates also factor in the cost of private parking available in the area. The on street permits generally cost more than private parking to encourage parkers to use parking lots.

Dehumidifiers regulate the humidity in a room by removing excess moisture from the air, thereby creating a living condition that is inhospitable to dust mites, mould and other allergenic organisms. They run quietly and efficiently in the background without most people even noticing. There are two types of dehumidifiers available, portable and whole house. For significant, year round issues of high humidity, get a whole house dehumidifier that uses your home\u2019s heating and cooling system to reduce the humidity throughout your entire house.

For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation.

A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air.

If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures.

Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems.

The valve has a flap that allows water to leave but closes to prevent water and/or sewage from entering. Backwater valves are designed to close the sewer line during periods of extreme rain to prevent water from entering your home. When the valve is closed you should not use any plumbing fixtures (i.e. toilets, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines) because water will not drain and will back up into your home. The Insurance Bureau of Canada recommends residents not install the plug type valves, as they allow sewer backup pressure to build beneath your basement floor, which may cause structural damage to your home. $500 to $2,000 including installation.

New models have WiFi capabilities with smart home integration. $25 to $150 Cool roofs reflect the sun\u2019s rays and reduce heat build up through a light coloured or highly reflective roofing product such as a coating, new membrane or shingle. Most roofs in Canada are dark in colour and absorb heat from the sun\u2019s rays transferring it into the rooms below. Because cool roofs are better at reflecting the sun\u2019s energy, less heat is transferred inside your home. As a result, you may not have to use your air conditioner as much, saving you energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cool roofs also increase the life expectancy of your roof, because they reflect the heat and UV rays that damage and age roof materials. Dark coloured roofs in high density areas also contribute to the urban heat island effect \u2013 significantly warmer temperatures in urban areas compared to rural areas. As a result of climate change, Kingston is expected to see dramatic increases in the number of extremely hot days due to continued global warming. Installing a cool roof is one way to help to offset this. There are cool roof options for all types of roofs, including steep slope (pitched roofs), low slope (flat roofs).. Roofing products are tested for their reflectivity and given a Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value between 0 100. The higher the number, the more reflective it is. If you want to convert an existing roof into a cool roof, you have the following options: Green roofs are living roofs. They support the growth of vegetation and consist of a waterproofing membrane, drainage layer, organic growing medium (soil), and vegetation. Green roofs capture stormwater, improve air quality and create habitats for pollinators, birds and other wildlife. Green roofs also help insulate your home in the summer and help reduce the overall temperature in Kingston. Green roof systems are generally classified as extensive, semi intensive or intensive. Your budget, vision and the structural capacity of your building will determine which type of green roof you select. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A sump pump is a small pump that is installed at the lowest part of your basement or crawlspace that prevents flooding. The sump is the low space that collects liquids, while the sump pump detects water in the sump and moves it away from your home through a network of pipes that is dug into the floor of the basement. Groundwater can easily rise through the cracks in your foundation during long periods of rain. If there is a possibility that flooding can occur in your basement or crawl space, a sump pump will collect all of this water and redirect it away from your home. There are two types of primary sump pumps available: submersible and pedestal pumps. Submersible pumps have the motor placed underwater in your sump basin, while pedestal pumps are positioned with the pump motor out of the water, above your sump basin. It is recommended that Kingston residents consider a submersible sump pump as they are the quietest, most powerful and effective sump pump. They also allow for an airtight lid that will stop debris from falling into the pit and prevent moisture and odorous air from being released into your home. $700 to $5,000, including installation.

It will create a new route for active transportation modes, such as pedestrians and cyclists. The route along Bayridge Drive features connected off road cycling facilities (designated routes for bikes) and will create a single protected route for cyclists of all ages and abilities and safer travel options for pedestrians. This particular corridor was first identified as a core route in the City\u2019s Active Transportation Master Plan (ATMP). That plan provides a high level view of the city\u2019s cycling infrastructure system and looks at how to improve the City\u2019s active transportation network for cyclists and pedestrians. From the ATMP, a five year work plan was developed, the Active Transportation Implementation Plan 2019 2023 (ATIP), which identified a portion of Bayridge as a major priority to build, as part of Route 6. Federal funding from the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program was also awarded to the City of Kingston, specifically to help improve pedestrian, cycling connections and transit access. Thanks to that support we have been able to expand the project to improve the experience for everyone who travels along this route. Once completed, a portion of this route, from Coverdale to Henderson, will also form part of the Great Lakes Trail. The most significant change will be the option for off road, protected cycling infrastructure along Bayridge Drive between Henderson Boulevard and Cataraqui Woods Drive, including intersection safety upgrades. Currently, the only cycling options on this stretch of Bayridge are on the road and unprotected. The new off road bike facilities will provide options for those who would like to use cycling as a means of transportation but are concerned about riding on the road by reducing the risk of interaction between drivers and cyclists. While on road cycling options will remain, we will be installing connected off road cycling facilities to create a continuous protected route for cyclists of all ages and abilities. All bike facilities are being designed in line with the most recent update of Ontario Traffic Manual 18 \u2013 Bikeway Design Guidelines. Upgrades to intersections will include marked crossings and bike signals at all signalized intersections. To improve pedestrian safety we will be reviewing lane configurations, turning space, marked crosswalks, traffic signal heads and signal timings to ensure that intersections are safer for pedestrians of all ages and abilities. The map below outlines how these different cycling facilities and intersections will connect to form a continuous route. View an enlarged version of the map. The map highlights the type and extent of cycling facilities being implemented along the corridor as part of this project. From the south, a bidirectional cycle track will run from Henderson Boulevard to Acadia Drive where through intersection design it will transition to unidirectional cycle tracks on either side of Bayridge Drive. These continue to Milford Drive where it transitions at the intersection to a multi use path that continues north to Cataraqui Woods Drive. We are adding sidewalks or multi use pathways along the corridor where no pedestrian routes currently exist to make it easier and safer walk along Bayridge Drive. We are reducing the need to cross the road as frequently and improving intersections that will make it safer for pedestrians to cross and slow down turning vehicles. We are building off road cycling options along Bayridge Drive between Henderson Boulevard and Cataraqui Woods Drive that can be used by all ages and abilities. Intersections will be redesigned to prioritize bikes by adding dedicated bike cross rides and bike signals. This will make commuting and recreational trips along the route safer and more enjoyable for all levels of cyclists. To learn more about the different types of cycling facilities Kingston uses visit our Cycling Infrastructure page. This project will also help to improve cyclist and pedestrian connections to existing local and express transit services along Bayridge Drive, which will make it safer and easier to use transit as part of your journey. You can expect to see some new features along the roadway that will reduce conflict points and make cyclists and pedestrians more visible at intersections, including green painted cross rides and bike signals at intersections. A southbound travel lane, between Hudson and Lincoln Drive, will be removed, while between Lincoln and Coverdale Drive a travel lane in both directions will be removed. The removal of these travel lanes will provide space for the off road bike route and extend walking facilities along the east side of the overpass between Lincoln and Coverdale. In preparation for this project we have completed a traffic impact study along this route and don\u2019t anticipate any significant traffic impacts related to these required lane reductions.

Gasoline and diesel use create over 30 per cent of Kingston's carbon footprint and electric vehicles can be over 60 per cent less expensive to operate than gasoline cars. In Ontario, EVs reduce air pollution across the province and in your driveway. Children are particularly susceptible to pollution from gasoline vehicles, as they are closer to the height of exhaust and their developing lungs have higher breathing rates than adults. The City's public EV charging stations are operated through the Flo Network and will consist of Level 2 and Level 3 chargers. To use a Flo charging station download the mobile app from Google Play or the App Store. Check out these short videos on how to use a Flo EV charging station: For 24/7 assistance with charging issues please call 1 888 356 8911. You can find the locations of activated EV chargers by using the Flo app or any of several other mobile apps for EV drivers. These parking spaces are intended for electric vehicles (battery electric and plug in hybrids) while charging. They are clearly marked with green paint and/or signage. As part of the City's commitment to reducing our carbon footprint, providing the infrastructure to support electric vehicles will encourage more residents to adopt this environmentally friendly alternative to traditional cars. Interested in learning more about electric vehicles? Check out plugndrive.ca or visit their Electric Vehicle Discovery Centre in North York, Ontario and test drive your next clean ride. Finding electric vehicle charging stations in Kingston and across Canada is easy using websites and smartphone apps and by using the GPS features included in most EVs. An electric car uses an electric motor, powered by a battery, instead of a traditional gasoline engine. The batteries in these vehicles need to be recharged when depleted. Electric vehicle charging stations are essentially specialized outlets that these vehicles can plug into to recharge their batteries while away from home. Level 2 chargers operate on 220 volts (like a dryer or stove) and can charge a vehicle in 3 to 6 hours, depending on vehicle type. Most EV owners will have a Level 2 charger at home for overnight charging. Level 3 chargers, also known as DC Fast Chargers operate on high DC voltage and can charge a vehicle in as little as 30 minutes depending on the vehicle type. Charging stations are owned by the City and operated by FLO. These charging stations are being installed as part of the City's commitment to climate action and environmental sustainability. Helping to make electric vehicles more convenient for residents, visitors and businesses in Kingston will encourage more residents to adopt this environmentally friendly alternative to traditional cars, and lower their carbon footprint. Anyone with a battery electric or plug in hybrid vehicle can use an EV charger as long as you have created account with the Flo network. EV chargers cannot be used for any purpose other than to charge electric vehicles. Yes. As of Jan. 1, 2020, Kingston's Level 2 and Level 3 electric car charging stations are available for a fee. Normal parking fees are applicable in pay parking lots and on street locations. EV drivers may use the public EV charging stations with a Flo Account, available through Flo.ca. Be considerate. Please don't park your regular vehicle in an EV charging spot. When charging spots are blocked, the people who need them can't use them.

The system then compresses the refrigerant and condenses it from a vapour to a liquid, releasing the heat so that the cooled/liquid refrigerant can be expanded and sent back into the home, where it starts the cycle again. There are two types of central air conditioner systems to choose from: $2,400 to more than $6,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Room air conditioners, also known as, window air conditioners, cool individual rooms rather than your entire home. These air conditioners are less expensive to operate than central air conditioners because they only provide cooling in areas that are needed. They are also a good option for residents in high rise buildings without central air conditioning. $200 to $600 Source: Natural Resources Canada Space and water heating are the biggest users of energy in Canadian homes which accounts for approximately 80per cent of residential energy consumption and 99per cent of GHG emissions in Ontario residences Boilers use gas or oil to provide space heating and hot water to your home. Boilers distribute heat using radiators or in floor radiant heating, eliminating the need for pre existing duct systems. Gas and oil boilers are subject to Canada\u2019s Energy Efficiency Regulations, which sets minimum performance standards for their energy efficiency. All boilers sold in Canada are energy efficient. Check the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) rating, the minimum should be between 82 and 84 per cent. Replacing your oil boiler? Consider switching to a natural gas boiler which tends to produce less waste and fewer harmful emissions. $3,000 to $8,000 Source: Natural Resources Canada If your house, or a room, has moist or wet stains on a wall or ceiling, musty odours, windows or pipes that are covered with condensation, and/or feels stuffy, you may need a dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers regulate the humidity in a room by removing excess moisture from the air, thereby creating a living condition that is inhospitable to dust mites, mould and other allergenic organisms. They run quietly and efficiently in the background without most people even noticing. There are two types of dehumidifiers available, portable and whole house. For significant, year round issues of high humidity, get a whole house dehumidifier that uses your home\u2019s heating and cooling system to reduce the humidity throughout your entire house. If the humidity is periodic or confined to one room, a portable unit is sufficient. Whole house units $1,000 \u2013 $2,000+; portable units $150 \u2013 $300.

Drain water heat recovery systems capture the heat from water going down a drain, typically the shower, and use it to heat cold water entering your water heater. It\u2019s particularly effective when there are simultaneous water flows i.e. when you\u2019re using hot water in the shower at the same time that water is flowing down the drain. $550 \u2013 $1,700 plus installation.

High efficiency gas furnaces are quiet, reliable, and effective at maintaining a comfortable home, and they can reduce your energy bill by up to 45 per cent. An ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified forced air furnace, fueled by gas uses 6 per cent less energy, fueled by oil uses 9 per cent less energy, on average than a standard model. Space heating represents more than half of your home\u2019s energy use and offers the most potential for reducing your energy bill. If your furnace was installed before 1990, it\u2019s probably a lower efficiency model, as regulations for furnaces in Canada have been updated since then. If you upgrade to an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified furnace, you will save money and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases you emit. $2,000 \u2013 $8,000.

For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation.

A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air. Choose an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ductless heating and cooling system to cut your electrical heating bill by up to 60 per cent, and your cooling bill by 30 per cent, depending on your climate. $2,500 to $5,000+ per unit, including installation.

If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures. Ground source heating produce less CO2 than other forms of space heating systems. $20,000 \u2013 $40,000, including installation.

Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems.

Water heaters with storage tanks are the most common in Canadian homes, but they are not the most energy efficient. Electricity, gas or oil is used to heat water stored in the tank and supply it, as needed, to household fixtures and appliances. Storage tanks typically hold between 113 and 378 litres of water in their tanks, and this water is continuously reheated and kept hot 24 hours a day. $800 to $1,500, plus installation.

History innovation thrive in our dynamic city located along the beautiful shores of Lake Ontario, an easy drive from Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, in the heart of eastern Ontario. With a stable and diversified economy that includes global corporations, innovative startups and all levels of government, Kingston's high quality of life offers access to world class education and research institutions, advanced healthcare facilities, affordable living and vibrant entertainment and tourism activities. Kingston is home to: The City also boasts an AA Standard & Poor's financial rating and engaged City employees committed to embracing sustainable practices and encouraging their adoption by the entire community.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment-sustainability/climate-change-energy/green-buildings": "Buildings and homes must be designed to meet minimum Ontario Building Code (OBC) requirements for energy efficiency. For large buildings, this currently includes conforming to ASHRAE 90.1 or the Model National Energy Code. However, there is growing concern about the need for more immediate action to deal with climate change, and there is room for improvement upon some of these minimum requirements. The City of Kingston is encouraging all builders, owners and stakeholders to consider designs for all new large buildings, and new and renovated homes using highly energy efficient and sustainable standards. While the City cannot force building permit applicants to meet energy efficiency requirements that are beyond the minimums required by the OBC (or ASHRAE in the case of industrial, commercial, institutional and large residential buildings), the purpose of these guidelines is to help explain and demonstrate the advantages of using improved standards like ENERGY STAR, EnerGuide or LEED. Green building rating systems are transforming the construction industry by focusing on high performance, energy efficient, economical and environment friendly buildings. These rating systems and standards are often voluntary and used as design checklists. Builders are encouraged to use the Green Checklists at right to help guide their projects. Though energy efficiency is a major component of designing a green building, several other basic sustainability requirements can be considered as well. Please select a heading from the following menu for further information: Rating systems challenge designers to go beyond the codes to improve overall building performance and sustainability, and to minimize life cycle environmental impact and cost. A green rating system can serve as both a guideline and a scorecard. The objective is not necessarily to use certain technologies, but rather, to build the whole building and site in a way that addresses a series of concerns. Since April 2004, it has been City of Kingston policy that all large municipal building and retrofit projects undertake an assessment using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system as a design goal for Council's consideration before finalization of a project's design. This official adoption of the LEED approach puts Kingston on the leading edge of sustainable development. (See more about LEED below.) Rating systems like LEED take an organized approach to evaluating sustainable building measures to help compare projects on a level playing field. Although not all systems require third party verification, the benefit of an independent system is that it provides greater assurance that all participants have met a better energy standard. Rating systems challenge designers to go beyond codes to not only improve overall building performance and sustainability, but also to minimize life cycle environmental impact and cost. These systems incorporate an all inclusive approach, and the resulting buildings are often the products of a team design. This design team should include not only the architects, engineers, occupants and owners, but also from the beginning of the project, specialists in indoor air quality, materials, energy, costs, etc. Some design systems address whole building location, design, and performance. This often involves a higher level of coordination, as well as documentation, administration and registration or certification fees. However, verification ensures a level playing field. Shortcuts are virtually eliminated especially with the involvement of a third party, and the final rating is meaningful and accurate. In addition, while some requirements are easier and less expensive to achieve in certain situations, most systems allow for a great deal of flexibility in achieving requirements and encourage innovation. Points are often awarded for making simple improvements over existing minimum standards. These improvements result in an earlier return on investment from energy savings, and add to the resale value of the building. There can be some disadvantages to using a building rating system. Yet, most are outweighed by the many benefits and cost savings over the lifespan of the building. The ENERGY STAR for New Homes initiative promotes guidelines that enable new homes to be approximately 30 percent more energy efficient than those built to the minimum building code standards. To meet ENERGY STAR for New Homes standards, a licensed builder may include the following options: Upon completion of the qualified home, an independent ENERGY STAR evaluator verifies that the home has been built to technical specifications. After the verification process is complete, Natural Resources Canada issues a label and certificate to the homeowner. The label is usually placed on the home's electrical panel and includes a regional service organization seal of authenticity. In addition to building an ENERGY STAR qualified new home, a house can receive an EnerGuide energy rating label to compare and rate the energy consumption of the home. To determine the energy rating (on a scale from 0 100), an energy advisor conducts an analysis of building plans, and performs an evaluation on the finished house. An EnerGuide label and report will then be provided from the advisor that outlines the level of energy efficiency. Although most new houses receive an energy rating of 68 or higher, the average ENERGY STAR qualified home in Ontario receives an energy rating of 80 or higher. LEED Canada for Homes is a rating system that promotes the design and construction of high performance green homes. This system goes beyond energy efficiency to ensure homes are highly sustainable in all aspects. The system measures the overall performance of a home in eight categories: The LEED rating system works by establishing a minimum level of performance through prerequisites, and then rewarding improved performance in each category. There are four levels of performance which are awarded based on the number of points earned: Certified, Silver, Gold and Platinum.

These Installations were all done under the now phased out Ontario Power Authority's (OPA) Feed in Tariff program (FIT) and Micro Feed in Tariff (MicroFIT) programs. The Green Energy and Green Economy Act, passed by the Ontario government on May 14, 2009, amended the Electricity Act to allow a municipality to generate up to 10 MW using a renewable energy generation facility. Previously, municipalities could only generate electricity using an independent corporation. This allowed municipalities to increase their revenue by participating in the OPA's now defunct FIT program and selling electricity into the grid. Under the now phased out FIT and microFIT programs, generators of renewable energy were able to sell electricity to the grid at an attractive fixed price under a 20 year contract. The FIT and microFIT programs are now closed and no longer accepting new applications. The following microFIT (10 kW) installations and are all online and generating clean renewable energy. The following Feed in Tariff installations are all online and generating clean renewable energy and revenue. While all of our existing systems are under the FIT and MicroFIT program and are guaranteed in a 20 year contract, with the shutting down of the FIT and microFIT programs all future solar photovoltaic system applications and installations will fall under the Net Metering Program. Net metering allows the City to send electricity generated from Renewable Energy Technologies such as Solar Photovoltaic to the electrical distribution system for a credit, reducing our electricity costs. Excess generation credits can be carried forward for a consecutive 12 month period to offset future electricity costs. The goal is to over generate during the summer months, and use up the excess credits during the winter months. The Net Metering program has no contract end date; once it begins producing energy it will continue to benefit the City for decades. Net metering is being explored in our municipally owned facilities to reduce operating costs, reduced GHG emissions and continue to improve the City's municipal energy mix. All of our new municipal facilities are being designed to have roof and electrical capacity for future net metering solar systems where financially and technically feasible.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment-sustainability/climate-change-energy/green-buildings/leed-green-building-information": "Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a rating system representing a holistic and environmentally responsible approach to building design.

These standards ensure that new City buildings maximize energy efficiency, provide the highest quality of indoor working environment and minimizes any building's burden on the natural environment and long term operating budgets. Under the certification program, buildings meet prerequisites and earn credits in a number of categories, including: Most of the credits are performance based, which means that they measure the degree of improvement relative to a recognized standard. A project can meet the criteria for one of four LEED levels \u2014 certified, silver, gold, or platinum \u2014 based on its total point score. These new City facilities are designed to achieve at least a LEED silver rating, and will expect to save at least a 40 per cent savings in energy costs: Recent experience has demonstrated that for certain buildings, the costs to meet LEED certification will achieve a payback in energy savings and efficiencies sufficient to offset the incremental capital costs over a reasonable period of time.

Municipalities that implement these changes would reduce the number of decisions that are made by Council and potentially enable Council to deal with other more strategic issues sooner. It is important to note that these new delegation provisions do not alter any notice or public meeting requirements or limit appeal rights for these types of applications. Staff presented an information report on these changes to Council on Nov. 16, 2021. Before exercising this new discretionary authority, the Official Plan would need to be amended to specify the types of by laws which may be subject to a delegation of authority. Additionally, as part of Ontario\u2019s More Homes, More Choice: Ontario\u2019s Housing Supply Action Plan, the Province appointed a Housing Affordability Task Force in December 2021. CBC News and TVO have recently covered this, noting that a report from the Task Force with recommendations on speeding up the development approvals process and measures to increase the supply of market housing is anticipated to be released on Jan. 31. These recommendations may lead to further changes to the Planning Act. Municipalities have been provided an opportunity to provide feedback on opportunities that exist to help address the housing crisis looking at policy, legislation and process. Staff are following media closely and are receiving information from Ministry partners and are eagerly awaiting the release of that report.

This is a major milestone for the Department of Planning Services and the corporation as a whole. The new document modernizes and simplifies zoning rules across Kingston, resulting in a comprehensive, innovative policy document that is easier for residents, planners and developers to interpret. Once completed, it will also assist with reaching several key priorities, outlined in the 2019 22 Strategic Plan. Last week, the final version of the bylaw was posted online, alongside supporting documents, appendices and the interactive zoning map. The documents reflect extensive public engagement and incorporates the zoning framework developed through the Central Kingston Growth Strategy (CKGS), which outlines a policy and regulatory framework to guide intensification specifically in the central area of the city. An Official Plan amendment is also proposed to implement the Kingston Zoning Bylaw and the recommendations of the CKGS.

In the 1980s, these areas had secondary plans completed that were never fully implemented. The age of the associated planning studies \u2013 and public interest in the proposed Wellington Street Extension \u2013 led to the decision to undertake a secondary planning process for the combined area in 2016. The first phase of the project involved the creation of a long term community vision, planning principles, and design directions to realize opportunities for this area and promote a sustainable, healthy, vibrant and livable community. The second phase of the project will involve a number of technical studies, including land use, transportation, servicing, and cultural heritage. Part of the process will include exploring transportation options and alternatives to the proposed Wellington Street Extension. The second phase of the project will involve five technical studies, including: The land use study for NKT will identify areas for growth and change, including intensification and infill development, as well as areas that are expected to remain relatively stable. It will involve all land use categories \u2013 residential, commercial, industrial, open space \u2013 as well as the protection of important natural heritage features. The land use plan will be complemented by urban design guidelines that will speak to appropriate built form for the various areas within NKT. The draft land use plan will provide a framework to lead the other technical studies. The transportation plan will explore transportation options for all modes of travel in and through NKT that support the broad objectives of the NKT visioning report. The plan will also explore alternatives to the proposed Wellington Street Extension. The servicing plan will examine existing infrastructure in NKT, including water, sanitary sewer, stormwater, electrical, and natural gas, and identify areas where improvements are needed to support future development proposed by the land use plan. The servicing plan will incorporate green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) as part of the development of future stormwater infrastructure. The cultural heritage resources study for NKT will identify areas of heritage resource potential (both built heritage resources and intangible heritage aspects) and will provide a strategy and recommendations for further conservation work. As part of the background research for the cultural heritage resources study, a historic chronology of North King's Town has been prepared to illustrate the timeline of past events. The financial and implementation plan for NKT will identify incentives, public investments, and other strategies to implement the recommendations of the other technical studies that form part of the secondary plan.

The Background Report offers basic planning information to help provide a context for the secondary planning process. The chronology provides an in depth review of the study area's history. Since the background report was completed, the project area has been expanded based on the work of the first phase that is outlined in the Visioning Report and Preliminary Market Analysis. The first phase of the project involved a community visioning exercise and a preliminary market analysis. The terms of reference for Phase 1 were approved by council at its December 1, 2015 meeting, and the City issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to hire a consulting team to assist with the work. On April 5, 2016, council approved the hire of a team of consultants lead by DIALOG to introduce the study to the community and see how it would like this area to change and grow. The results from this project will inform the terms of reference for the next phase of the secondary planning process. The terms of reference for Phase 2 were approved by council at its July 11, 2017 meeting, and the City issued a Request for Proposals to hire a consulting team to assist with the work. On November 7, 2017, council approved the hiring of a team of consultants led by DIALOG to conduct the five technical studies associated with Phase 2 of the NKT Secondary Plan.

Rideaucrest is committed to enriching the lives of people who require the long term support of a safe and caring community in which all voices are valued and personhood and dignity are respected. Each long term care home service provider is required to draft an accountability agreement between the local health integration network (LHIN) and the long term care service provider. This agreement is called an LSAA. This agreement sets out the terms on which the LHIN will provide funding to the home, and the performance obligations of the home in return for that funding. It promotes continuous quality improvement and the efficient delivery of high quality health services to all Ontarians \u2013 and it reflects Ontario's quality transformation agenda currently underway in the long term care home service sector. The basic and semi private rooms have identical layouts. Each room has a spacious closet, electric bed with mattress, bedside table, chair, pillows and linens. The bathroom is shared with a neighbour and is accessible from both sides. It has separate cupboards for storing personal items. Private accommodations are slightly larger than the basic and semi private rooms and have a private bathroom. Rideaucrest residents are encouraged to decorate their rooms to reflect their own tastes, preferences and personalities. Long term care is part of the province's health care system and is publicly funded on a cost shared basis with residents. The province pays for health care and related programs and services (about two thirds of the total cost), and the resident pays the remaining cost, which covers room and board type services and any additional cost for private or semi private accommodation. A person's application for admission to a long term care home is based on his/her medical needs, not the ability to pay. The province provides a subsidy for those in basic accommodation who are unable to afford the full resident co payment. Upon admission, you can provide your notice of assessment from the most recent tax year and the finance office at Rideaucrest will be happy to help you complete the rate reduction forms. Resident accommodation charges are subject to change on July 1 of each year. Thirty days' notice will be provided prior to any rate changes. Each year the government adjusts the maximum amount a resident pays in long term care.

The City of Kingston, in partnership with Tourism Kingston, has recently unveiled a unique and public installation designed by local architecture firm, RAW Design Inc. (RAW). Titled Water Snake, this is a playful, interactive installation designed to delight and engage residents and visitors along Kingston\u2019s waterfront. Water Snake is nestled along the pathway between the Delta Hotel and Battery Park and is an experiment in animating an underdeveloped space in a semi permanent way through a combination of design and technology, involving innovative and sustainable 3D printing done by local company, Nidus3D. The installation features three distinct sculptural segments that offer seating and that also encourage play and interaction. It is meant to help create a sense of place and to propose new ways of thinking about public spaces and how we use them. The installation is animated by a ground mural artwork created by local artist, Jenny Moring. This project is supported by funding from the Canada Community Revitalization Fund.

Paved Paradise is a temporary public art project that features the work of Kingston based artists on seven pedestrian level billboards at the corner of Ontario and Brock Streets, adjacent to City Hall in downtown Kingston. The project was created in 2018 as a response to a Council directive to \u2018beautify\u2019 a city parking lot at Brock and Ontario streets. Paved Paradise is an important temporary public art platform that provides local emerging artists with a medium scale opportunity to exhibit a body of work that responds to a project goal or theme. Through this exhibition platform, the selected artists who work primarily in 2 dimensional mediums (drawing, illustration, photography, graphic arts) have an opportunity to translate their work to a larger scale public facing exhibition. This is the first artistic collaboration between Lee Stewart and Bree Rappaport. Both are Kingston based artists. Lee Stewart was born and raised in Kashechewan, a small remote reserve on James Bay in northern Ontario. He spent years in the Rideau Lakes region, and studied film and art history at Carleton University in Ottawa. He then lived in Vancouver before returning to establish himself in Kingston. Stewart\u2019s cultural influences are as vast as his lived experience, without hierarchy or elevated status. As a self taught artist, Stewart\u2019s experimentation, innate curiosity, and openness continue to shape his evolving style. Bree Rappaport holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Ontario College of Art and Design University. While in school, she pursued projects around social and environmental justice, community economic development, and art as an educational tool for the needs of marginalized people. She lives and works in Kingston, dividing her time between teaching art based classes at Leahurst College and the Agnes Etherington Art Centre. Rappaport maintains an art practice as a member of Dead On Arts Collective and 12 Cat Arts Collective. As an artist, Rappaport hopes to empower people, to be bold and brave when faced with fear or uncertainty. Art is a question, an action, a way \u201cto make sense of things\u201d. Her practice is driven through constant inquiry on quotidian aspects of life and human nature. Subject matter such as landscapes and autonomous human figures are common themes in her work. Painting, drawing and projection are the main tools in her wheelhouse of creation. Rappaport thinks of her viewer as \u201ceveryone\u201d in or out of her art community, aiming to make accessible work that speaks to people from all walks of life. Collaboration is like a dance. Communicating back and forth, avoiding missteps and asking for forgiveness when stepping out of line or on any toes. This project was created, in collaboration between Lee Stewart and Bree Rappaport. This is the first project of this nature for both artists. Lee and Bree have known each other for five years, meeting through Dead On cCollective. Lee and Bree are close to opposites as artist and people, but through collaboration, their styles come together harmoniously. The square is in a constant state of flux, moving from one space to another, one idea to another, and sometimes these ideas overlap. We know that art is subjective to each viewer and hope this work will encourage viewers to bring their own history and narrative to this work. How do they see themselves in Kingston\u2019s historical narrative? We would like this piece to uplift people to dream about the new prospective possibilities in our town. Our making process is in constant flux. As the idea of liminal, thinking about time is not as lineal. Everything is months ahead. Occupying space.

Artists were invited to submit a proposal for a large scale mural, in place for up to 5 years, or pillar wraps, that would be in place for up to one year. The pillars are at ground level and are accessible to all users who pass through the INVISTA Center.

Laurene King McGill FOREVER, 2001 Quilt The 2019 expansion of the YGK Airport provided an opportunity to re visit the potential for public art within the airport as a way to enhance the visitor experience. This resulted in the creation of two distinctly different projects, including; a mural project inspired by King McGill\u2019s original work and a media wall designed to feature a rotating program of digital art. The mural project is currently installed and more information can be found below. The media wall will feature work created by commissioned digital artists through open calls for submission that can be rotated according to a schedule.

Vincent P\u00e9rez HOM(E)ING, 2019 Printed vinyl wrap and printed acrylic panel and lettering Through the City of Kingston\u2019s Public Art Policy, local artist Vincent P\u00e9rez was directly commissioned for the mural project and created a public art work titled \u201cHom(e)ing.\u201d The artwork is installed next to the entrance of the newly reconfigured security area. Art type: Permanent Budget: $27,800 Location: YGK Airport, 1114 Len Birchall Way, Kingston, ON Installation has been completed. Vincent P\u00e9rez is a designer, letterpress printer and artist living in Kingston, Ontario. He is dedicated to art as public practice, design as collaborative process and printing in the analog tradition. This mural takes the form of a collage of graphic elements that are referential to Laurene King McGill's remarkable quilt titled Forever, which was previously commissioned by and displayed in the airport, while drawing on the symbology of human flight and transportation. From geometric grids that recall traditional quilt block designs, but also hint at propellers, compasses and stars for celestial navigation, to vectors that suggest data visualization of aviation airways, but also resemble the thread used in quilt construction, to a larger than life naturalist illustration of a Canada Goose by John James Audubon*, the artwork is at once a tribute to both the quilt and the theme of air travel. The piece is punctuated by a quote by Elisabeth K\u00fcbler Ross that can serve as a simple reflection on the mystery of the homing instinct in birds, but that can also speak to human migration or even our metaphorical \"journey\" through life, the latter having special relevance to King McGill's health \"journey\" during the making of her quilt. The mural was created in consultation with Laurene King McGill. King McGill\u2019s incisive and generous advice significantly improved the piece and her recommendations for the quilt block designs were invaluable. Above all, it was a pleasure to consult and converse with a fellow craftsperson, designer and artist who understood and felt invested in my creative process and its outcome. *Cited Source, Canada Goose by John James Audubon: The Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/explore/culture-history/arts/public-art/permanent": "Public art will be integrated into the City's capital planning and budgeting process and be included in plans for new and renewed facilities, parks and infrastructure.

Zoning Bylaws implement the policies in the Official Plan. Zoning Bylaws contain specific provisions to regulate the use of land, lot sizes and lot development standards. If a development proposal does not conform to the requirements of the Zoning Bylaw, a building permit cannot be issued. Information about the City's Official Plan and Zoning Bylaws and copies of the documents can be obtained at the City's Planning & Development Department, located at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. The Planning & Development Department is responsible for reviewing and providing a recommendation to Council regarding development applications. The timely processing of applications requires co operation from and co ordination with numerous internal and external stakeholders, including the applicant. The development review process includes the following main steps. Not all steps are required for every application \u2013 for example, for some applications there is no requirement for a public meeting, and in some cases, the approval authority has been delegated by Council to staff. Please select a heading from the following menu for more information: The City welcomes and encourages comments regarding the development review process. Council's adopted priorities include an emphasis on customer service excellence, building an \"open for business\" culture, and enhancing service by streamlining the development review process. There are many ongoing customer service initiatives related to the development review process. The following Council Report 12 268 provides information about the status of these initiatives. The Final Report of the Mayor's Task Force on Development also outlines a number of recommendations for improving the City's development review process. Required forms and information: Pre application meetings are a mandatory part of the development review process for applications for Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw Amendments, Site Plan Control, and Draft Plans of Subdivision and Condominium. Pre application for Committee of Adjustment applications (consents and minor variances) is arranged with the Planner assigned to deal with these applications. Please contact the planner of the day by calling 613 546 4291 ext. 3180. Pre application meetings are held every third Tuesday morning at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. View the meeting schedule. At the Pre application meeting you will meet with staff from City departments (e.g. Planning, Building & Licensing, Engineering and Utilities Kingston) and external agencies (e.g. Conservation Authority). At the meeting, the required approvals, supporting studies (e.g. traffic impact, tree preservation, stormwater management, parking, noise), drawings and other information to be submitted with an application will be identified. Any technical issues that will need to be addressed will also be identified. The submission requirements and application fees will be confirmed by the assigned Planner on the Development Application Pre Application Meeting  Study and Plan Identification List) that is provided to you following the meeting. While the intent of the pre application meeting is to identify all requirements related to the proposal, on occasion additional information/studies may be required based on staff's review of your formal application submission and further project details. Proposals discussed at pre application are confidential until a formal application is submitted. The City no longer accepts paper based applications \u2013 we have gone digital using DASH! All planning applications are now made through our DASH portal. Links to tutorials and guides are also available to assist users with making their application. Planning staff are always available to provide assistance with submissions at the customer service counter at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. For all applications the following information must be provided in order for the application to be submitted through DASH: Note: Planning, Building & Licensing Services collects the Planning and Engineering fees as part of the initial application submission. Some external agencies (e.g. Conservation Authority and Health Unit also charge fees for reviewing development applications and you are responsible for paying those fees directly to the commenting agency. The assigned Planner will review the completed application form and accompanying information to determine if the application is complete. The processing of an application may be delayed until all required information has been submitted. Poor quality plans and supporting reports or incomplete information submissions will result in delays in the processing of an application. If you have any questions regarding the studies or supporting information that is required for a complete application you should contact the Planner assigned to your file at pre application. When your application has been reviewed and it is confirmed that your submission includes all the required information, a Letter of Complete Application will be provided to you. While the municipality has 30 days under the Planning Act to make this determination, it is done as soon as possible. If the application is not complete, a Letter of Incomplete Application will be provided to you outlining the additional information, reports or studies that are required. If you disagree with the City's assessment of the completeness of the application you should contact the assigned planner to discuss this. If agreement is not reached, the Planning Act provides 30 days for you to make a motion to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal for a determination on the matter and the Tribunal's decision is final. When all required information has been submitted, a Letter of Complete Application will be issued. The City is required to provide a Notice of Complete Application within 15 days after the Letter of Complete Application has been issued for Official Plan, Zoning Amendments and Plans of Subdivision. Whenever possible, the City combines the Public Notice of Complete Application and the Public Meeting Notice (discussed further below), provided that the notice requirements for both can be met. If that is not possible, then the Notice of Complete Application will be given separately in order to meet the legislative requirements, and the Notice of the Public Meeting will be given later. Any timelines mandated by the Planning Act for a decision on your application(s) start once an application has been deemed complete. For some applications (Site Plan Control and Committee of Adjustment) the timeline starts upon receipt of the application and required information, but there is no requirement to issue a notice of complete application. The planner assigned to your file will circulate your application together with the appropriate plans and studies to various City departments and external agencies, typically within 5 working days from complete application receipt. Depending on the application type and location of the property, the circulation list may include City Council, the District Councillor, municipal departments (e.g. Planning, Building & Licensing, Engineering, Utilities Kingston, Parks, Fire & Rescue, Transportation, etc.), external agencies (Kingston Economic Development Corporation, Conservation Authority, Health Unit), school boards, abutting municipalities (e.g. Loyalist Township, South Frontenac Township), utility companies (e.g. Hydro One, Bell, Cogeco, Union Gas, Trans Canada Pipelines), railway companies, provincial ministries (e.g. Municipal Affairs, Housing, Environment and Climate Change, Natural Resources and Forestry) and federal departments (e.g. Parks Canada, Fisheries and Oceans, Canada Post). Responses to the initial technical circulation are required within 10 working days from the date of circulation (30 days for plans of subdivision) and within five working days for subsequent circulations (15 days for plans of subdivision). Responses received are reviewed and consolidated by the assigned Planner, The Planner also provides comments based on their review of the technical comments and planning policy and site design. These comments are forwarded to you and/or your agent. Where there are a significant number of responses, a meeting may be arranged with you and / or your agent to review the comments to ensure there is an understanding of the issues and any additional information to be provided. You are then responsible to respond to the staff / agency comments and submit any required additional information and revised drawings to the assigned Planner, who then re circulates the material to the appropriate departments / external agencies. As needed, the assigned Planner will also work with you and arrange meetings with departments or external agencies to address technical comments or concerns. Complete re submissions that address all of the technical responses are key to enabling the various departments / agencies to fully review the revised drawings and updated information in the context of their previous comments and provide a response within the requested time frame. This process of applicant submission, City review / comment and applicant re submission continues until such time as all departments / agencies have signed off on the proposal. Approval of applications for Site Plan Control, Final Plan of Subdivision and Consent has been delegated by Council to staff. However, the procedures governing Council's delegated authority provide for a \"bump up\" to a Committee or Council for final approval. In the case of an application for Site Plan Control or Final Subdivision approval, Council is circulated the applications and a motion of Council is required to \"bump up\" the application to Planning Committee or Council respectively. Where a Consent application is \"disputed\", the application is referred to the Committee of Adjustment. The procedures also provide that staff or the applicant can also request a \"bump up\". This could occur if you disagreed with one or more of the municipal conditions of approval or where there is disagreement between staff and the applicant respecting required works. If there is a \"bump up\" request, the timelines for processing the application will be impacted given the need for preparation of a staff report to the applicable Committee or Council and consideration of the application at a Committee or Council meeting. The Planning Act requires that at least one public meeting be held for applications for Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw amendments, Draft Plans of Subdivision / Condominium and Committee of Adjustment applications (\"disputed\" consents and minor variances). The Act sets out the notice procedures (form, content and timing) and the people to be notified. Where applications are being processed concurrently, one consolidated public meeting will be held for all the applications. The City provides formal notice of the public meeting by both first class mail and the posting of signage on the subject lands. You are responsible for preparing and/or installing the required sign in accordance with the City's signage specifications. Courtesy notice is also posted on the City's website and is included on the City page of the newspaper. Where the matter affects large areas or the entire municipality, Notice is published in the newspaper. Notice of the public meeting must be given: There is no requirement to hold a public meeting or provide formal public notice for Site Plan Control (SPC) applications, applications for Final Subdivision / Condominium approval, or applications to Lift Part Lot Control and Remove a Holding Symbol. The City's procedures require that a sign is posted on the property for Site Plan Control and Committee of Adjustment applications. For these applications you will be provided with a sign to post on the property by the planner assigned to your file. The Planning Committee typically meets on the 1st and 3rd Thursdays of each month and the Committee of Adjustment meets the 4th Monday of each month. At the public meeting, you or your agent are expected to make a presentation describing the proposed development, summarizing any key studies and reports and providing the rationale for the applications. Staff may then supply any supplementary information as well as a brief summary of any public input received. Committee members may ask you questions for clarification. Interested members of the public may make written submissions to the Committee or appear before the Committee to comment on the application or ask questions. Once all public input has been received, you or your agent is given an opportunity to respond to the comments and summarize the application. After this, the public meeting is closed. In some cases an application may be amended following the public meeting in response to technical comments or issues identified by the public or the Committee. Depending on the nature of the changes, a second public meeting may be required. A second public meeting could also be required if the notice for the public meeting was not provided properly. Following the public meeting, Planning Committee, at a second Planning Committee Meeting, will consider a comprehensive report and make its recommendation to Council. Following the public portion of a Committee of Adjustment meeting, the Committee discusses and makes a recommendation on the application. Following the public meeting, the assigned Planner will prepare a comprehensive report to Planning Committee. This report will include an analysis of the proposed development and the applicable policies and bylaws, a summary of submitted reports or studies, a discussion of the issues raised in any of the technical responses and at the public meeting (including any specific matters identified by Committee members), and a recommendation to the Committee whether the application should be approved or rejected. If the comprehensive report recommends approval of the application, any conditions to the approval will be included (e.g. conditions of draft plan approval) together with a draft of the proposed Amending Bylaws (Official Plan and / or Zoning Bylaw). The draft conditions and amending by laws will be circulated to you and your agent for review and comment prior to finalizing the report. The time required to prepare the Comprehensive Report will depend on the complexity of the project, the type of application, the nature of public input received, any identified technical matters, and the need for any additional information from the applicant. In some cases, particularly for large developments or ones that have become controversial, the City may require some of the supporting studies to be peer reviewed. A peer review is an independent review of the study submitted by a qualified professional in that field of study. Typically studies such as market impact or environmental impact studies for large developments are peer reviewed. You are responsible for the cost of the peer review. Once the comprehensive report is drafted by the assigned Planner, it is reviewed/approved by management staff in Planning, Building & Licensing and then forwarded to the Commissioner of Community Services. The report is then submitted to the clerks department for inclusion on the Planning Committee agenda. All reports are also reviewed/signed by the Chief Administrative Officer. Some reports may also require sign off by other Commissioners. The comprehensive report and recommendations will be considered during a regular meeting of the Planning Committee. During the Planning Committee's discussion of the application, questions may be directed to staff respecting the report or recommendations and members of the public will have the opportunity to provide oral comments. The Committee may recommend to City Council that the application be approved with or without changes to the staff recommendation and draft Bylaws or that the application be denied. In some cases, based on the Committee's discussion, the application may be deferred or referred back to staff until additional information is received, either from you or staff. Planning Committee's recommendations are forwarded to City Council for approval. The Planning Committee Report is considered by Council in open session and Council may adopt the Committee's recommendation, amend it, reject it or refer it back to the Planning Committee or staff for further consideration / information. If an application is approved by City Council, the amending Bylaw respecting Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw amendments will be given all three readings and passed at that City Council meeting or a Draft Plan of Subdivision may be approved . After the Committee of Adjustment or City Council makes a decision on an application, the Planning Act requires that Notice of that decision be issued. The Act prescribes the form of the Notice, the timing for issuing the Notice, and the persons to whom the Notice must be given. For Committee of Adjustment applications, Notice respecting a minor variance application must be given not later than ten days after the decision is made, and for consent applications, within 15 days after the decision is made. The Notice includes information on the approved variances and land severance together with any conditions imposed by the Committee. The Notice also sets out the final day for any appeals to be submitted. For all Committee of Adjustment decisions, the City typically provides Notice within 2 3 days following the decision. For applications for Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw amendments and Draft Plans of Subdivision / Condominium, Council must give Notice within 15 days from the date of the decision or passing of the amending Bylaw. The Notice of Adoption (Official Plan amendment), Notice of Passing (Zoning Bylaw amendment) and Notice of Decision (Draft Plan) include information on the Bylaw amendments (location, purpose and effect) as well as the conditions of draft plan approval. The Notice also sets out the final day for any appeals to be submitted. In most cases, the City provides the required Notice within 7 \u2013 10 days following the decision. If no appeals to the Committee / Council decisions are received, the decisions are final and come into effect. The Planning Act provides for an appeal process for decisions on planning applications. Any person with an interest in the matter may appeal a decision of the Committee of Adjustment or Council to the Ontario Land Tribunal provided that they made a presentation at the public meeting or provided a written submission prior to the decision being made. The appeal must be filed within the appeal period as set out in the Notice and must identify the portion of the decision being appealed and the reasons why. If an application is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the final decision will be made following a Tribunal Hearing. For more information on the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, refer to the Citizens' Guide created by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. You can apply for your building permit at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. A building permit is your formal permission to begin construction or demolition. It means that the City of Kingston has reviewed the plans for any new structure, addition or renovation. Your plans must comply with the Ontario Building Code, local Zoning Bylaws, and other applicable laws and regulations. At the building permit stage the City will collect the applicable development charges and impost fees. Building permits regulate the type of construction allowed and help to ensure building standards are met. The building permit process protects your interests, as well as those of the community and helps to ensure that any structural change is safe, legal and sound. By obtaining a permit, you can also take advantage of the professional expertise of Building Division staff. Inspectors are good sources of information and can offer suggestions to help solve construction problems, often before they occur. Even if your designer or contractor obtains the permit on your behalf, you are ultimately responsible for complying with all building requirements.

Once you file for pre application consultation, however, the assigned Planner will be your main point of contact throughout the development review process. Your development proposal will have to comply with the Planning Act, the Ontario Heritage Act, the Provincial Policy Statement and other Provincial or Federal legislation and municipal Bylaws or policies. The City also has an Official Plan and Zoning Bylaws that establish the long term vision and permitted uses for properties. In accordance with Bylaw 2007 43, Pre application Meetings are mandatory prior to the submission of the following planning applications: There is a $300 fee for this service. Please note that you are encouraged to contact staff informally at any time if you require further information or clarification, or if you are developing land for the first time. Applications that may not require formal pre application include: However, you are strongly encouraged to speak with City staff before submitting any application to ensure that you are aware of the applicable process and submission requirements. All development applications are submitted via the Development and Services Hub (DASH). When your application is submitted, the assigned planner will review it to ensure that the submission is complete. It is very important that the application submission include all information, plans and supporting studies in good quality that were identified at the pre consultation meeting. If there is incomplete information or the plans or documents are of poor quality, your application will not be considered complete and may be delayed. If there are any questions regarding what studies or supporting information is required in order to submit a complete application, you should contact the assigned planner to your file. Once the application is determined to be complete, it is circulated to the appropriate City staff and external agencies for review and comments. Most applications require more than one circulation to staff and external agencies. To ensure timely processing of your application it is very important that any additional information or amendments to plans identified through circulation is submitted as quickly as possible and that the revisions address all of comments/requirements noted in the responses from staff and the external agencies. Yes. When a development proposal requires multiple approvals (e.g. Official Plan and/or Zoning Bylaw Amendment and Draft Plan of Subdivision), you are encouraged to file all applications concurrently. Filing concurrent applications can streamline your review process because it allows the City to hold one consolidated public hearing for all applications and ensures that sufficient information is available to facilitate review of the applications. You are also encouraged to file applications for Site Plan Control, Heritage Permit and Building Permits concurrently. Processing time will depend on the nature and complexity of the proposal, the completeness of your submissions, turnaround times when additional information is requested by staff or external agencies, the need for peer reviews of submitted reports or studies, the level of public input received through the process, and any appeals to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal of Council and Committee decisions. Staff can provide a general processing timeline at the pre consultation meeting and will continue to advise you regarding timing through each step of the approval process. It is important to note that the target timelines for processing an application will not commence until a complete application has been submitted. No. Council has delegated some of its approval authority to staff for certain types of applications. Planning & Development staff has the authority to approve applications for Site Plan Control, Final Subdivision and Consents and the release or reduction of Site Plan Control securities.

The Registry staff helps applicants select an \"area of preference\" and reviews housing mandates and eligibility criteria. Each month, the Social Housing Registry Program provides a waiting list to housing providers. It includes the names of all applicants who are eligible and/or have indicated a preference in their particular housing project. When a vacancy occurs, offers of accommodation are made to eligible applicants by individual housing providers \u2014 NOT by The Registry. To be eligible for rent geared to income assistance you must meet the following criteria: See the motions establishing City's standards governing rent geared to income eligibility.

Titled Water Snake, this is a playful, interactive installation designed to delight and engage residents and visitors along Kingston\u2019s waterfront. Water Snake is nestled along the pathway between the Delta Hotel and Battery Park and is an experiment in animating an underdeveloped space in a semi permanent way through a combination of design and technology, involving innovative and sustainable 3D printing done by local company, Nidus3D. The installation features three distinct sculptural segments that offer seating and that also encourage play and interaction. It is meant to help create a sense of place and to propose new ways of thinking about public spaces and how we use them. The installation is animated by a ground mural artwork created by local artist, Jenny Moring. This project is supported by funding from the Canada Community Revitalization Fund.

Paved Paradise is a temporary public art project that features the work of Kingston based artists on seven pedestrian level billboards at the corner of Ontario and Brock Streets, adjacent to City Hall in downtown Kingston. The project was created in 2018 as a response to a Council directive to \u2018beautify\u2019 a city parking lot at Brock and Ontario streets. Paved Paradise is an important temporary public art platform that provides local emerging artists with a medium scale opportunity to exhibit a body of work that responds to a project goal or theme. Through this exhibition platform, the selected artists who work primarily in 2 dimensional mediums (drawing, illustration, photography, graphic arts) have an opportunity to translate their work to a larger scale public facing exhibition. This is the first artistic collaboration between Lee Stewart and Bree Rappaport. Both are Kingston based artists. Lee Stewart was born and raised in Kashechewan, a small remote reserve on James Bay in northern Ontario. He spent years in the Rideau Lakes region, and studied film and art history at Carleton University in Ottawa. He then lived in Vancouver before returning to establish himself in Kingston. Stewart\u2019s cultural influences are as vast as his lived experience, without hierarchy or elevated status. As a self taught artist, Stewart\u2019s experimentation, innate curiosity, and openness continue to shape his evolving style. Bree Rappaport holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Ontario College of Art and Design University. While in school, she pursued projects around social and environmental justice, community economic development, and art as an educational tool for the needs of marginalized people. She lives and works in Kingston, dividing her time between teaching art based classes at Leahurst College and the Agnes Etherington Art Centre. Rappaport maintains an art practice as a member of Dead On Arts Collective and 12 Cat Arts Collective. As an artist, Rappaport hopes to empower people, to be bold and brave when faced with fear or uncertainty. Art is a question, an action, a way \u201cto make sense of things\u201d. Her practice is driven through constant inquiry on quotidian aspects of life and human nature. Subject matter such as landscapes and autonomous human figures are common themes in her work. Painting, drawing and projection are the main tools in her wheelhouse of creation. Rappaport thinks of her viewer as \u201ceveryone\u201d in or out of her art community, aiming to make accessible work that speaks to people from all walks of life. Collaboration is like a dance. Communicating back and forth, avoiding missteps and asking for forgiveness when stepping out of line or on any toes. This project was created, in collaboration between Lee Stewart and Bree Rappaport. This is the first project of this nature for both artists. Lee and Bree have known each other for five years, meeting through Dead On cCollective. Lee and Bree are close to opposites as artist and people, but through collaboration, their styles come together harmoniously. The square is in a constant state of flux, moving from one space to another, one idea to another, and sometimes these ideas overlap. We know that art is subjective to each viewer and hope this work will encourage viewers to bring their own history and narrative to this work. How do they see themselves in Kingston\u2019s historical narrative? We would like this piece to uplift people to dream about the new prospective possibilities in our town. Our making process is in constant flux. As the idea of liminal, thinking about time is not as lineal. Everything is months ahead. Occupying space.

Public art at the INVISTA Centre is a public art opportunity for Kingston based emerging artists only. This project also aims to bring public art to the west end of Kingston and to animate the facility. In 2018, the City of Kingston issued a public call for submissions to Kingston based artists to create public art for the atrium of the INVISTA Centre. Artists were invited to submit a proposal for a large scale mural, in place for up to 5 years, or pillar wraps, that would be in place for up to one year. The pillars are at ground level and are accessible to all users who pass through the INVISTA Center.

You may get a new or replacement Green Bin if yours has been lost, stolen or broken at (reminder: only one Green Bin is allowed per household): Kingston Area Recycling Centre, 196 Lappan's Lane. Please bring your damaged Green Bin with you to have it replaced. Monday to Friday \u2013 Damaged Green Bins may be dropped outside and new or replacement Green Bins picked up inside the administrative building, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday \u2013 New or replacement Green Bins may be picked up at the scalehouse. The City only collects Green Bin materials from City issued Green Bins. . A choice of either a 80L or 45L will be provided at the time of pick up (there will be no option to switch sizes at a later date). Each property may put out one Green Bin. Material put out in additional Green Bins or yard waste bags will not be collected (paper leaf bags are only picked up during fall leaf collection). Kitchen containers, for collecting food waste in your kitchen, can also be purchased at KARC for $4.00. Backyard composters are also available at KARC for $52.45. The Green Bin takes items that can't be put in backyard composters \u2013 like meat, bones, shells, dairy products, fats and oils. DO put these in your Green Bin: DO NOT put these in your Green Bin: Don't know where it goes? Use our Waste Sorting Look up. Though they are not required, the use of Green Bin and kitchen container liners can help reduce odours, improve cleanliness and helps ensure that all materials are collected. Liners can also prevent material from freezing to the green bin in the winter. Green Lid compost container: Residents are able to use the Green Lid compost containers in the City's green bins. Please make sure to only place the container in the green bin. The lid is not compostable and needs to be placed in the garbage. NOTE: Not all kitchen container or Green Bin liners sold in Kingston are accepted in Kingston Green Bins. Bags that are marked \"Oxo Degradable\" or produce bags are not accepted in Kingston Green Bins. Place acceptable items loosely or in an acceptable liner and set your City green bin out at the curb by 6 a.m. as close to the roadway as possible, without obstructing the sidewalk on your collection day every week (see collection calendar).

The types of development that require Site Plan Control are listed in the Site Plan Control Bylaw. A City Planner is assigned to each application as part of the Pre Consultation stage and works closely with the applicant to address technical comments, arrange meetings, and discuss concerns. The planner is the main point of contact for the applicant throughout the processing of their application. Site Plan Control is legislated under Section 41 the Ontario Planning Act and allows the City to review and control important aspects of a proposed project  for example, the siting of buildings, landscaping, pedestrian access, parking, exterior design and appearance, stormwater management and waste disposal. Kingston's Site Plan Control Guidelines describe the application process, submission requirements, payment of fees, financial securities, supporting reports and studies that may be required, technical circulation, and other essential information. The time required to complete the Site Plan Approval process will vary depending on the complexity of the project and completeness of submissions. Once the Site Plan is approved, the City and developer enter into a legally binding Site Plan Control Agreement. A building permit is generally not issued until Site Plan Control requirements are addressed and final approval is granted. Depending on circumstances and timelines, a conditional or partial building permit may be an option to allow foundation work to commence. This is considered at the request of the applicant and reviewed by all technical departments prior to a decision being made. A Pre Application meeting is mandatory for all Site Plan Control Applications. Meetings are held every third Tuesday morning (view the schedule). A copy of the Pre Application report must be included with the complete Site Plan Control application (i.e. all required fees, drawings and supporting studies). Pre consultation will identify the approvals that are required as well as the supporting briefs or reports that must be submitted with the Site Plan Control application. Some examples are: traffic impact study, tree preservation plan, stormwater management study, parking study, noise study, etc. Pre consultation also identifies any outside agencies that must be contacted, such as: For properties that have previously received Site Plan Control approval, revisions to the approved site plans may require a Site Plan Modification approval and, in some cases, an amended Site Plan Control Agreement and/or the submission of additional financial securities. Applicants for Site Plan Control approval can expect to pay a number of fees. The full Site Plan Control application fee, which includes planning, and engineering fees, must be paid when the application is submitted for approval. The Site Plan Control approval process also considers the design of projects to ensure they generally conform with surrounding buildings and enhance existing development in Kingston. Site Plan Control specifically looks at the movement of pedestrians and traffic on the site, access to and from abutting streets, building location and design, the design of parking areas, garbage and recycling storage areas, site servicing (sewer, water, gas, electric), stormwater management, landscaping, noise impact, snow removal and storage. Depending on the location of the property, the City may specify that certain design elements be included in the project, for example, building materials or buffering requirements. The design of the project must also meet all accessibility requirements. The Municipal Accessibility Advisory Committee supports the review of Site Plan Control applications to ensure the facility is accessible for all. Please review the Site Plan Accessibility Checklist to ensure that the proposed development is designed to meet accessibility requirements. As part of the Site Plan Control process, the City prepares an 11 inch x 17 inch sign which must be posted on the property to advise the public that an application for Site Plan Control has been submitted, to describe the proposal and to provide a contact should additional information be required. It is the responsibility of the applicant/developer to post the signs on the property according to the City's requirements. The Planner assigned to the project will circulate the appropriate plans and studies to various internal departments of the City and external agencies, as part of a technical circulation. Responses to the initial technical circulation are required within 10 working days from the date of circulation and within five working days for subsequent circulations. Comments received are forwarded to the applicant or agent by the Planner. Additional information, including revised drawings, to address the technical circulation comments, must be submitted to the assigned Planner, who will re circulate the material to the appropriate departments and agencies for further review. The Planner will also work with the applicant to address technical comments or concerns and arrange meetings, if required. Complete submissions are important to ensure departments are able to review all relevant drawings and revisions and provide comments within the requested time frame. The Director of Planning and Development is delegated Council's authority to approve Site Plan Control applications unless they have been \"bumped up\" to the Planning Committee through a motion of Council, in which case approval rests with the Planning Committee. Mayor and members of City Council are notified of all Site Plan Control applications. In such cases, the Planning Committee Courtesy Notice published in the local newspaper will include the Site Plan Control application as an item to be considered by the Committee. In certain cases, the applicant or staff may also request that an application be \"bumped up\" to Planning Committee. The Committee may choose to approve the application in principle and refer it back to the Director of Planning & Development for final approval, subject to conditions (e.g. all outstanding technical issues being resolved). The Site Plan planner will prepare the draft site plan control agreement for review by the applicant and legal services. Once the agreement and conditions are satisfactory to all parties the agreement is forwarded to the developer for signing. The signed agreement is then returned to the City for execution and registration. Prior to final approval of the application, the applicant/developer must submit three copies of the signed Site Plan Control Agreement, required securities, seven copies of the final Site Plan drawings, and an electronic version of the drawings. The City may impose conditions of approval. If the applicant disagrees with the proposed conditions, they can request that the application be \"bumped up\" to Planning Committee or can appeal these conditions to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. If construction fails to start within one year of the date of the Site Plan Control Agreement, the City at its option can withdraw approval of the plans and declare the Agreement to be null and void. It is the responsibility of the applicant/developer to remove all signage from the property once Site Plan Control approval is complete. Once final Site Plan Control approval has been granted, the project is ready for the Building and Construction phase. Once construction is completed as per approved plans including landscaping, the applicant may request to reduce or release financial securities as per the conditions set out in the Site Plan Control agreement.

Those who have made significant contributions to our community through volunteerism in the areas of culture, heritage, recreation, sports, health, education, health care, environment, safety, volunteering or business may be acknowledged with one of these esteemed awards: This award, the highest civic honour in Kingston, recognizes a lifetime of volunteer work by an individual whose efforts have left an indelible mark on our community. It takes long, hard, meaningful work to earn Kingston\u2019s top award, which is open to citizens of all ages. Also open to citizens of all ages, this award is intended to recognize more specific volunteer efforts \u2013 and those who make them shine. These awards recognize youth in three categories \u2013 elementary, high school and post secondary youth up to age 24 \u2013 who demonstrate leadership, care and compassion and/or ability to overcome personal challenges, motivate others or use special skills to improve the community\u2019s quality of life. Described as a community builder by his friends and family, Jimmy is actively involved in charitable efforts in Kingston. As a strong supporter of Martha\u2019s Table and Lunch by George, he has provided meals on numerous occasions to those experiencing food insecurity. He has started several community initiatives including Project Red Rose, a program to feed marginalized community members on Valentine\u2019s Day, and an annual blanket drive to provide warmth for those in need. The culmination of Jimmy\u2019s community focused work was the creation of Canadian Colours Kingston Foundation, a not for profit that aims to foster a community centred around inclusion, diversity and understanding. Donna has always had a place in her heart for feral felines. She launched The Forgotten Ferals, a local cat rescue, upon noticing a growing number of stray cats and kittens near her workplace. For the past eight years, Donna has led a group of volunteers and worked with other local rescues to reduce cat overpopulation with a Trap, Neuter (spay), Vaccinate and Return service, and by helping feral cats find loving homes through foster and adoption programs. Dr. Ma showed exceptional leadership while co ordinating mass COVID 19 vaccination clinics in the city with Kingston Frontenac Lennox & Addington Public Health. She provided direction to volunteers with a positive and encouraging attitude through all kinds of weather. She also coordinated the \u201cVaccine Roadshow\u201d, a temporary mobile vaccination unit. Dr. Ma is a dedicated primary care physician lauded for her strong commitment to the community\u2019s health and safety. Guided by her own lived experience Brooke started a student run organization, Bags of Promise, with the help of a fellow post secondary student to provide dignity centred support for youth experiencing homelessness. The organization is focused around three pillars of advocacy, service and education, and distributes reusable bags containing hygiene items, clothes and other necessities to those in need. Brooke extends this same care and compassion to her work as a crisis line and accompaniment volunteer with Sexual Assault Centre Kingston. Andrew\u2019s athletic and academic interests have led him to be a thoughtful leader and caring role model to both elementary and secondary school students. He has volunteered as a coach, referee, and scorekeeper for school sports, and took on a leadership role running the Ontario Special Olympics basketball tournament at Bayridge Secondary School. Andrew consistently goes above and beyond by creating personal connections with staff, faculty and students, and even volunteering for events at other schools in Kingston. Anti oppression, accessibility and compassion are at the heart of Yara\u2019s volunteer efforts at school and in the community. During her time at Queen\u2019s University, she has led several awareness and action based initiatives including the Bystander Intervention Training Program for student leaders; educational campaigns as Director of Dawah and Education for the Muslim Student Association; the National Mentorship Program within the Queen\u2019s Student Diversity Project; and the creation of Equity and Accessibility Grants to equity deserving students. She also brings her capacity as a translator to support refugee and immigrant (or newcomer) families settling in Canada and have more accessible experiences. Yara is a passionate advocate for social change and institutional reform and strives to make lasting changes for a more equitable and just community. At 12 years old, Julia demonstrates that volunteerism can start at any age. She is a grade six student who took up crocheting to make scarves and ear warmers for youth experiencing homelessness in Kingston. She has since combined her generosity and entrepreneurial spirit to launch a crochet business, in which 25 per cent of the proceeds are donated to a community organization.

Dehumidifiers regulate the humidity in a room by removing excess moisture from the air, thereby creating a living condition that is inhospitable to dust mites, mould and other allergenic organisms. They run quietly and efficiently in the background without most people even noticing. There are two types of dehumidifiers available, portable and whole house. For significant, year round issues of high humidity, get a whole house dehumidifier that uses your home\u2019s heating and cooling system to reduce the humidity throughout your entire house.

An ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified forced air furnace, fueled by gas uses 6 per cent less energy, fueled by oil uses 9 per cent less energy, on average than a standard model. Space heating represents more than half of your home\u2019s energy use and offers the most potential for reducing your energy bill. If your furnace was installed before 1990, it\u2019s probably a lower efficiency model, as regulations for furnaces in Canada have been updated since then.

For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation.

A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air.

If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures. Ground source heating produce less CO2 than other forms of space heating systems. $20,000 \u2013 $40,000, including installation.

Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems.

In November 2020, staff completed an update to the Williamsville Main Street Study, which included a review of the land use and built form policies and zoning provisions for development along the corridor, including locations for taller buildings and greater density. This work was supported by a detailed transportation study and a review of the available servicing capacity. On December 1, 2020, Council passed amendments to the Official Plan and the zoning by law to implement the update to the Williamsville Main Street Study. One site specific appeal was received regarding these amendments. The appeal had the effect of extending the Interim Control By Law that applied to the Williamsville Main Street Corridor until the date the Ontario Land Tribunal (OLT) made a decision on the matter. In an effort to resolve the appeal, Minutes of Settlement were executed between the City and the appellant in June 2021. A settlement hearing was held before the OLT on June 23, 2021. A formal Order was issued by the OLT on July 16, 2021 approving the settlement.

It\u2019s the single most important thing you can do improve the energy efficiency of your home and should be the first step of any retrofit project. You can save up to 30 per cent of your energy costs by air sealing areas where energy loss occurs. Air sealing impacts the building envelop of your home. The building envelop is the physical separator between the conditioned and unconditioned environment, including the resistance to air, water, heat, light, and noise transfer. Older homes typically have more air leaks, around windows and doors, electrical outlets, and cracks in the foundation and walls. You can seal air leaks in your home with weather stripping and caulking or by applying gaskets and tapes. $200 \u2013 $1,500 Source: Natural Resources Canada In addition to providing security, energy efficient doors prevent air and temperature leak from the house. Doors come in a variety of materials, some of which reduce heat flow better than others. Depending on the style and type of insulation, for example, metal clad doors can be more efficient than solid wooden doors. No matter what the material, ill fitting doors lose energy and can make your home drafty and uncomfortable. $200 or more per door. Source: Natural Resources Canada Insulation helps keep outdoor air from getting inside your home. It also prevents indoor air from escaping. For maximum energy efficiency, attics should be sealed, insulated, and ventilated. Air leaks in your attic will cause substantial heat loss and lead to a variety of moisture related problems in your home. $1.50 to $3.50/sq. ft. Source: Natural Resources Canada A basement can account for about 20 per cent of a home\u2019s total heat loss. Adding insulation to your basement is important whether or not space will be finished. For optimal energy efficiency, your home should be properly insulated from the roof down to its foundation. Much like your attic, basements need to be sealed, insulated, and ventilated. Proper insulation not only reduces heating and cooling costs but also improves comfort. The materials used to insulate your basement will depend on your foundation and whether you need to insulate inside or outside of your home. $6,500 to $18,000 Walls can account for up to 20 per cent of heat loss in your home. In addition to heat loss through your walls, cracks and penetrations may allow uncontrolled air leakage into and out of your home. Insulation is designed to prevent heat or sound from being transmitted from one area to another. It works by trapping pockets of air and slowing down the in/out process. The type of insulation you need will depend on the type of walls (i.e. solid, concrete block, frame) in your home. You can install one or more of the following: blown in, rigid board, batt/blanket and spray foam insulation. $150 to $3,000, plus installation.

Municipal water supplies in Kingston are not currently fluoridated. The City is providing information about water fluoridation on this page. While sections of East Kingston used water fluoridation a number of years ago, it was discontinued in October 2008. In Ontario, seven out of ten residents have access to fluoridated water. If you would like to learn more, please see the topics listed below. Fluoride is a colourless, naturally occurring mineral that can be found throughout the Earth\u2019s surface. It can be found in solid, liquid and gas forms. Fluoride is a mineral that can be found in your bones and teeth and is commonly used in dentistry. Community water fluoridation involves adjusting fluoride levels in the municipal water supply. Only water that is piped in as part of the municipal water supply can be fluoridated. Fluoridation requires additional utility infrastructure, in addition to standard water delivery methods. Find more information: What is Fluoride and how does it work in the water supply? No, Kingston\u2019s water supply is not currently fluoridated. A number of national and international health, medical, and dental organizations support water fluoridation as a public health measure to prevent tooth decay.

On March 1, 2016 Council passed a motion which directed staff to look at ways to ensure that there are opportunities for the public to provide meaningful feedback on Planning Act applications that are presented at planning committee meetings. The City's planning process, following the legislated requirements of the Planning Act and associated Ontario regulations, generally involves two presentations of an application before the planning committee and the public. The first presentation is a public meeting, followed by a presentation associated with a comprehensive report. Based on the outcome of the review, a new process was rolled out on December 14, 2017 which introduced an opportunity for the public to provide oral comments on Planning Act applications at the time comprehensive reports were presented before the planning committee. Prior to this change, members of the public were provided an opportunity to provide oral comments at public meetings only. Only committee members could ask questions of staff at the time comprehensive reports were presented. The typical planning process followed for a site specific application for a zoning bylaw amendment is illustrated below. Due to the complexity and nature of some applications, the order and number of steps may vary: Click for a larger view Offer your input: proposed open house approach In order to further enhance public participation in the planning process and to better integrate it with the City's Public Engagement Framework, staff are considering adding an open house event to the public consultation process for complex Planning Act applications. At the Sep. 20, 2018 planning committee meeting, staff presented a draft approach related to open houses. This approach is intended to complement and enhance the level of public participation in the planning process. To learn more, view the staff report and presentation. Staff will consider all input received and prepare a recommendation report to implement improvements to public participation in the planning approvals process.

Designation under the Ontario Heritage Act gives a property special legal status. This legal status is designed to protect cultural heritage resources located on the property. Although designation status is registered on the title of the property and requires certain actions on the part of a property owner, the owner retains control of the property. There are approximately 1400 properties that have been identified as having cultural heritage value in the City of Kingston. Properties that are designated are protected either individually under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act, or as part of a Heritage Conservation District under Part V. Listed properties have architectural or historical significance and are protected from demolition. You can look up the heritage status of your property via the Heritage Property Register. To officially find out the status of your property, or to obtain additional information on designating your property, contact heritage staff at heritageplanning@cityofkingston.ca. The Heritage Kingston committee, is an advisory body to City Council in all matters pertaining to Part IV and Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act. The function of the committee is to advise Council on local heritage matters and to assist the Council in carrying out its heritage conservation program. Heritage Kingston makes recommendations regarding applications for new designated properties, alterations to designated properties, loans, grants and the development of an inventory of designated and listed properties. The committee also serves as an advocate for architectural conservation by working closely with City Council and other municipal departments regarding heritage issues. All members are volunteers from the community and typically meet on the first Monday of each month; however, the Monday meeting may be scheduled in an alternate week. A list of meeting dates is provided on the Heritage Permits page under the Application Deadlines tab. You will be required to submit a heritage permit application (via DASH) for any plans to make alterations or renovations to the exterior of a designated property. You are also required to submit a heritage permit application for any new construction within a Heritage Conservation District. A designated property's external elements include, but are not limited to, a building's roof, porch, steps, windows, trim, and the re pointing of masonry, major landscaping, and painting the exterior where the colour scheme will differ from the original colour. Some designated heritage properties also include protection of interior features; please contact Heritage & Urban Design staff to see if your property has an internal designation. Owners of listed properties are encouraged to discuss their plans of alteration or renovation with Heritage staff and the Heritage Kingston for free advice and assistance and to take advantage of the Heritage Kingston's resources that may otherwise not be available. The owner of a designated property must also seek Council approval to demolish any part of a designated property. We recommend you contact the City's Heritage staff to determine whether or not a pre consultation or site visit is appropriate for your application. Pre consultation is free and both City staff and the Municipal Heritage Committee are very willing to discuss your proposed renovations, provide advice and help where they can. Also, should you choose to pre consult, you are likely to develop a better application \u2013 making the process easier for you. Even if you are only thinking about making alterations or renovations to your heritage property, an appointment can offer you excellent advice on the application process and the architectural and historic preservation of your property. Should your proposed alteration and/or demolition plans require heritage approval either through staff or Council you will be required to submit a heritage permit application (via DASH) and follow the process as described on the Heritage Permit page. Staff are available to answer any questions regarding obtaining your Heritage Permit.

A Zoning Bylaw amendment is a Bylaw passed by City Council. Since the Zoning Bylaw implements the Official Plan, a proposed Zoning Bylaw amendment must still conform to the Official Plan. If it does not, the proposed Zoning Bylaw amendment may not be appropriate without first obtaining an Official Plan amendment. The process for amending a Zoning Bylaw is made up of the following steps: Step 1  Consult with Planning & Development Staff: You should discuss your plans with planning staff at the planning and development department before you submit the application. The planner will: The planner may also suggest that other city departments such as the engineering department and/or Utilities Kingston be consulted before you submit the application to determine if there are any development issues or concerns related to the property. Step 2  Submit the Application: After you have consulted with city staff, you will need to submit the following to the planning & development department: Applications will not be accepted if incomplete or inaccurate information is provided. Once the application has been received, you will be sent a letter advising you of the planner who will be responsible for your application. Step 3  Application Review: The planner will send out a notice to interested parties requesting to receive notification that your application has been received. The application will also be provided to other city departments and outside agencies for review and comment. Step 4  Public Meeting Report to the Planning Committee: Once the application review is completed, it will be considered by the planning committee, which is one of the standing committees of City Council. A public meeting report to the planning committee will be prepared by the planner. This report will include a description of the subject lands, a summary of the proposed development and an outline of the regulations and policies that relate to the application such as those in the Official Plan, Zoning Bylaw and the Provincial Policy Statement. Step 5  Notice of Public Meeting: Once the public meeting report has been prepared, a statutory public meeting at the planning committee needs to be scheduled to consider your application. This public meeting will also consider other development approval requirements for your application, such as Official Plan amendments, should they be required. A 'Notice of Public Meeting' will be posted on the City's website, published in the Kingston Whig Standard as well as mailed to all property owners within 120 metres of the subject lands and to other interested parties requesting to receive notification at least 20 days before the meeting date. In addition to the notice, you will also be required to install signage on the subject lands that notifies the public about this meeting. Information on signage requirements for major applications is available on this website. Step 6  Public Meeting: The planning committee typically meets on the first and third Thursdays of every month Public meetings generally start at 6:30 p.m. and are held prior to the regular meeting of the planning committee. At the public meeting, you or someone on your behalf will make a presentation describing your proposed development and the reasons for the Zoning Bylaw amendment. The planner will supply any additional information required as well as a brief summary of the public meeting report. At this point any interested party may make written submissions to the planning committee or appear before the committee to comment on your application. Once all public input has been received, you will have an opportunity to respond to the comments. After this, the public meeting will be closed. Step 7  Comprehensive Report to the Planning Committee: The planner will collect all of the comments made at the public meeting and prepare a comprehensive report. This report will include an analysis of the proposed development, a discussion of the issues raised at the public meeting and a recommendation on whether your application should be approved or rejected. If the comprehensive report recommends approval of your application, a draft of the proposed bylaw to amend the Zoning Bylaw will also be included. Step 8  Regular Meeting of the Planning Committee: Based on the planner's comprehensive report and the comments made at the public meeting, your application will be considered during a future regular meeting of the planning committee. The planning committee will then prepare its recommendation to City Council to approve your application with or without changes, reject your application or defer its decision until additional information is received. Step 9  City Council Meeting: During a City Council meeting, City Council may adopt the planning committee's recommendation, amend it, reject it or refer it back to the planning committee for further information. If your application is approved by City Council, the Bylaw to adopt the Zoning Bylaw amendment will be given three readings at that City Council meeting. Step 10  Notice of Passing: After City Council approves a Zoning Bylaw amendment, a 'Notice of Passing' will be sent by the city clerk in accordance with the requirements of the Planning Act. This notice will include information on the Bylaw to adopt the Zoning Bylaw amendment and will provide a 20 day period within which an appeal of the Bylaw may be made to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. Any person with an interest in the matter may appeal the decision of City Council to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal provided that they made a presentation at the public meeting or provided a written submission prior to the decision being made. Step 11  Approval: If no appeals to the bylaw are received, the Zoning Bylaw will come into effect. If the bylaw is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the final decision regarding approval or rejection of your application will be made following a Tribunal Hearing. After your application has been submitted and deemed to be complete, it will generally take from four to six months to process the application to the stage where a recommendation can be made by City Council. If no appeals to the Zoning Bylaw amendment are received, it will come into effect. The approval process may be longer for applications that propose major developments, deal with complex supporting information or extensive public input or require additional development approvals such as a Draft Plan of Subdivision or an Official Plan Amendment (note that if an Official Plan Amendment is also required, there may be an opportunity for the City to deal with both the Official Plan Amendment and Zoning Bylaw Amendment applications at the same time). If an application is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the hearing process will add time to the approval procedure as well.

The system then compresses the refrigerant and condenses it from a vapour to a liquid, releasing the heat so that the cooled/liquid refrigerant can be expanded and sent back into the home, where it starts the cycle again. There are two types of central air conditioner systems to choose from: $2,400 to more than $6,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Room air conditioners, also known as, window air conditioners, cool individual rooms rather than your entire home. These air conditioners are less expensive to operate than central air conditioners because they only provide cooling in areas that are needed. They are also a good option for residents in high rise buildings without central air conditioning. $200 to $600 Source: Natural Resources Canada Space and water heating are the biggest users of energy in Canadian homes which accounts for approximately 80per cent of residential energy consumption and 99per cent of GHG emissions in Ontario residences Boilers use gas or oil to provide space heating and hot water to your home. Boilers distribute heat using radiators or in floor radiant heating, eliminating the need for pre existing duct systems. Gas and oil boilers are subject to Canada\u2019s Energy Efficiency Regulations, which sets minimum performance standards for their energy efficiency. All boilers sold in Canada are energy efficient. Check the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) rating, the minimum should be between 82 and 84 per cent. Replacing your oil boiler? Consider switching to a natural gas boiler which tends to produce less waste and fewer harmful emissions. $3,000 to $8,000 Source: Natural Resources Canada If your house, or a room, has moist or wet stains on a wall or ceiling, musty odours, windows or pipes that are covered with condensation, and/or feels stuffy, you may need a dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers regulate the humidity in a room by removing excess moisture from the air, thereby creating a living condition that is inhospitable to dust mites, mould and other allergenic organisms. They run quietly and efficiently in the background without most people even noticing. There are two types of dehumidifiers available, portable and whole house. For significant, year round issues of high humidity, get a whole house dehumidifier that uses your home\u2019s heating and cooling system to reduce the humidity throughout your entire house. If the humidity is periodic or confined to one room, a portable unit is sufficient. Whole house units $1,000 \u2013 $2,000+; portable units $150 \u2013 $300. Source: Natural Resources Canada Heating water accounts for up to 20 per cent of a home\u2019s energy use, making it the second highest energy consumer after space heating. Drain water heat recovery systems capture the heat from water going down a drain, typically the shower, and use it to heat cold water entering your water heater. It\u2019s particularly effective when there are simultaneous water flows i.e. when you\u2019re using hot water in the shower at the same time that water is flowing down the drain. $550 \u2013 $1,700 plus installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada A furnace uses ductwork and vents to distribute warm air throughout your house. High efficiency gas furnaces are quiet, reliable, and effective at maintaining a comfortable home, and they can reduce your energy bill by up to 45 per cent. An ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified forced air furnace, fueled by gas uses 6 per cent less energy, fueled by oil uses 9 per cent less energy, on average than a standard model. Space heating represents more than half of your home\u2019s energy use and offers the most potential for reducing your energy bill. If your furnace was installed before 1990, it\u2019s probably a lower efficiency model, as regulations for furnaces in Canada have been updated since then. If you upgrade to an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified furnace, you will save money and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases you emit. $2,000 \u2013 $8,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Space heating accounts for 60per cent of the energy used in the average Canadian home. For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Home Space heating accounts for about 60 per cent of the energy used in the average Canadian home. A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air. Choose an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ductless heating and cooling system to cut your electrical heating bill by up to 60 per cent, and your cooling bill by 30 per cent, depending on your climate. $2,500 to $5,000+ per unit, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Space heating accounts for about 60 per cent of the energy used in the average Canadian home. If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures. Ground source heating produce less CO2 than other forms of space heating systems. $20,000 \u2013 $40,000, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Homes built after 1977 are typically more airtight, which helps to prevent heat loss but also prevents air circulation, which is important for your health and comfort. Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems. Source: Natural Resources Canada Heating water accounts for approximately 20per cent of your home\u2019s energy bill. Water heaters with storage tanks are the most common in Canadian homes, but they are not the most energy efficient. Electricity, gas or oil is used to heat water stored in the tank and supply it, as needed, to household fixtures and appliances. Storage tanks typically hold between 113 and 378 litres of water in their tanks, and this water is continuously reheated and kept hot 24 hours a day. $800 to $1,500, plus installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Heating water accounts for about 20 per cent of a home\u2019s energy expense. Tankless water heaters heat water as it flows, and only when required, using an electric element or gas burner. They provide endless hot water and the heat on demand feature means you only pay to heat water as you use it, instead of paying to keep a tank of water heated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. $1,000 to $2,800 Source: Natural Resources Canada", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/city-publications": "Explore the City produced publications below to find out more about City priorities, budgets, services, programs, plans and initiatives.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/zoning-by-law": "City Council enacted the new Kingston Zoning Bylaw Number 2022 62 on April 26, 2022.

The Plan recognizes that the City is made up of a wide variety of urban, suburban, agricultural and rural land uses as well as a number of defining environmental features. It serves as the blueprint for how the City will grow over the next 20 years and will assist in making Kingston Canada's most sustainable city. The Official Plan also provides a framework for establishing the City\u2019s zoning bylaw to set local regulations and standards, for example, those related to how land or buildings are used, where buildings can be located, the height of buildings, etc. The Official Plan for the City of Kingston came into effect on January 27, 2010.

December 1, 2022 consolidation Please select a heading from the following menu for further information: The Official Plan is the document in which the City of Kingston sets out its land use planning goals and policies that guide: This Official Plan repeals and replaces the former City of Kingston Official Plan, and the Township of Kingston and Pittsburgh Township Official Plans, except for specified secondary plans. The Planning Act requires that municipalities in Ontario adopt an Official Plan that is consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement. It is intended to guide development in Kingston until 2036, but will be reviewed every five years in accordance with the requirements of the Planning Act and may be amended by the City to reflect changing circumstances or new priorities for resource protection, growth or redevelopment. The Official Plan consists of both written policy and attached maps. It is organized into 10 main sections. The Plan is organized to move from fundamental and broadly based planning principles, and strategic policy approaches of the City to the more specific land use policies, resource and utility policies, implementation tools, and then to secondary plans and specific policy areas, which are more detailed provisions for specific geographic areas of the City. The Official Plan is the main tool for ensuring that future development and redevelopment are properly managed and directed to appropriate locations within the municipality. Without an Official Plan, the municipality could experience haphazard development, resulting in higher service costs and increased property taxes. In addition, many day to day problems would result from conflicting land uses that could create unacceptable living and working conditions. Yes, the Official Plan affects every City of Kingston resident. The Plan determines where new houses, stores, industries, schools, parks, and other land uses will be built; protects our natural environment; and directs the construction of new services such as sewers, watermains and roads. Sometimes due to new conditions in the community or a proposed development, an Official Plan may need to be changed or 'amended'. An Official Plan amendment is a Bylaw passed by City Council. An amendment may seek to change the land use designation of a property and/or apply new policies to that property as part of a proposed development or expansion to an existing use that is not allowed under the existing Official Plan. An Official Plan amendment may also require other approvals before the development can take place such as a Zoning Bylaw amendment. Although Official Plans must be approved by the Provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, City Council has been granted authority to approve Official Plan amendments. With Official Plan amendments, the applicant must be able to show City Council that the proposed development meets the City's long term plans for the area and is compatible with surrounding land uses. The process for amending an Official Plan is made up of the following 11 steps: You should discuss your plans with City planning staff before you submit the application. A planner will: The planner may also suggest that other city departments such as the engineering department and/or Utilities Kingston be consulted before you submit the application to determine if there are any development issues or concerns. After you have consulted with city staff, you will need to submit the following to the planning department: Applications will not be accepted if incomplete or inaccurate information is provided. Once the application has been received, you will be sent a letter advising you of the planner who will be responsible for your application. The planner will send out a notice to interested parties requesting to receive notification that your application has been received. The application will also be provided to other city departments and outside agencies for review and comment. Once the application review is completed, it will be considered by the planning committee, which is one of the standing committees of City Council. A public meeting report to the planning committee will be prepared by the planner. This report will include a description of the subject lands, a summary of the proposed development and an outline of the regulations and policies that relate to the application such as those in the Official Plan and the Provincial Policy Statement. Once the public meeting report has been prepared, a statutory public meeting at the planning committee needs to be scheduled to consider your application. This public meeting will also consider other development approval requirements for your application, such as Zoning Bylaw amendments, should they be required. A 'Notice of Public Meeting' will be posted on the City's website and published in the Kingston Whig Standard as well as mailed to all property owners within 120 metres of the subject lands and to other interested parties requesting to receive notification at least 20 days before the meeting date. In addition to these notices and depending on the nature of your application, you may also be required to install signage on the subject lands that notifies the public about this meeting. The planning committee typically meets on the first and third Thursday of every month. Public meetings generally start at 6:30 p.m. and are held prior to the regular meeting of the planning committee. At the public meeting, you or someone on your behalf will make a presentation describing your proposed development and the reasons for the Official Plan amendment. At this point any interested party may make written submissions to the planning committee or appear before the committee to comment on your application. Once all public input has been received, you will have an opportunity to respond to the comments. After this, the public meeting will be closed. The planner will collect all of the comments made at the public meeting and prepare a comprehensive report. This report will include an analysis of the proposed development, a discussion of the issues raised at the public meeting and a recommendation on whether your application should be approved or rejected. If the comprehensive report recommends approval of your application, a draft of the proposed Bylaw to amend the Official Plan will also be included. Based on the planner's comprehensive report and the comments made at the public meeting, your application will be considered during a future regular meeting of the planning committee. The planning committee will then prepare its recommendation to City Council to approve your application with or without changes, reject your application or defer its decision until additional information is received. During a City Council meeting, Council may adopt the planning committee's recommendation, amend it, reject it or refer it back to the planning committee for further information. If your application is approved by City Council, the bylaw to adopt the Official Plan amendment will be given three readings at that City Council meeting. After City Council approves an Official Plan amendment, a 'Notice of Adoption' will be sent by the City Clerk within 15 days of Council's decision pursuant to the requirements of the Planning Act. This notice will include information on the Bylaw to adopt the Official Plan amendment and will provide a 20 day period within which an appeal of the Bylaw may be made to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. Any person with an interest in the matter may appeal the decision of City Council to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal provided that they made a presentation at the public meeting or provided a written submission prior to the decision being made. If no appeals to the bylaw are received, the city clerk will issue a declaration that no appeals were filed and that the Official Plan amendment has come into effect. If the bylaw is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the final decision regarding approval or rejection of your application will be made following a hearing process. After your application has been submitted, it will normally take four to six months to process the application to the stage where a recommendation can be made by City Council. The approval process may be longer for applications that propose major developments, deal with complex supporting information or extensive public input or require additional development approvals such as a Zoning Bylaw Amendment (note that if a Zoning Bylaw Amendment is also required, there may be an opportunity for the City to deal with both the Official Plan Amendment and Zoning Bylaw Amendment applications at the same time). If an application is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the hearing process will add time to the approval procedure as well.

It is an area of special character that has a distinct \"sense of place\". The heritage resources within a Heritage Conservation District include buildings, structures, cultural landscapes, and sites of archaeological potential. The Ontario Heritage Act is Provincial legislation that allows designation of a district and the protection of an area's \"heritage character\". The Village of Barriefield was designated as a Heritage Conservation District in 1980, and the related Heritage Conservation District Plan was last updated in 1992. In order to meet the current provincial requirements, the District Plan will need to include: The new statement of cultural heritage value for each property not only provides the owners with a brief history of the building but also outlines how that building contributes to the District and makes it a special place. The new guidelines will provide direction for owners, staff and Council when alterations are being proposed. This will ensure that alterations are appropriate for, and maintain the character of the District. The list of minor alterations will tell owners which alterations require a heritage permit and which do not. The new guidelines will also provide direction related to infill development, potential vacant land development, public works projects, accessibility, and green energy. The expectation for restoration and maintenance of the property is the same for property owners in the District as it is for any property owner. The basic process will likely not change, however the requirements for permits (what is minor and what is not) and the guidelines by which applications are evaluated will be updated and outlined in the new District Plan. A Heritage Conservation District Plan does not affect the permitted (zoned) uses of the property nor does it prohibit the development or alteration of a property, but approval by Council is required for certain alterations. A district designation does not necessarily prevent changes in permitted use (such as rezoning). The new District Plan will outline the cultural heritage value of the District, including each property and list those elements that define its heritage character (known as \"heritage attributes\"). Development that takes place on or adjacent to the District must consider these attributes when designing their development projects. A Heritage Impact Statement, prepared by a qualified heritage professional, would be required in order to assess the impacts of the development on the heritage attributes and the character of the District, and must recommend ways to mitigate those impacts. The new District Plan will outline the cultural heritage value of the district, including key streetscapes and landscape design elements that help to define the heritage character. Improvements to roads within the District, for example, must consider and weigh these elements against safety, accessibility, drainage and other factors when designing their projects. Consultation with City heritage staff and/or the Municipal Heritage Committee may be required. On behalf of the City of Kingston, MHBC Planning has prepared an Issues Analysis Report, which reviewed the current Heritage Conservation District Plan and outlines the comments received from the public open houses in May and June 2014. Following comments received last fall regarding the first draft of the new Village of Barriefield Heritage Conservation District Plan, the 2nd Draft of the District plan is now available for review. If you have questions or wish to provide comments you can contact Ryan Leary, Senior Heritage Planner, at 613 546 4291 ext. 3233 or rleary@cityofkingston.ca.

(The almost in this case refers to a limited number of properties that have old permissions under the former zoning by laws). While Council approved the new Kingston Zoning By law Number 2022 62 (ZBL 22 62) at a special meeting on April 26, two appeals were submitted to the Ontario Land Tribunal, which held up the entire by law. At a settlement hearing on September 28, the Ontario Land Tribunal issued an oral decision confirming that the vast majority of the by law is in effect (all portions that are not under appeal). In harmonizing, simplifying, and modernizing the zoning provisions, ZBL 22 62 supports new economic development through simplified and flexible definitions that encourage new industries and business innovations to thrive across the city. Home occupation permissions allow for flexible business opportunities while still ensuring that residential neighbourhoods maintain their planned function. New complementary use permissions have been added for places of worship and new rules support schools, recognizing the importance of these community facilities in our neighbourhoods. ZBL 22 62 supports a more vibrant, healthy, and diversified rural area by protecting our most important agricultural resources while expanding the range of agricultural uses and allowing for new agri tourism uses. It supports on farm diversified uses and agriculture related uses, and focuses rural growth to the hamlets. It also introduces new permissions for \u201crural uses\u201d, seasonal cabins and bunkhouses, providing new opportunities and ways for our residents and tourists to our area to enjoy rural lands. Residential permissions of ZBL 22 62 are inclusive and focused on equitable housing opportunities for all people. The rules focus on land use impacts and are intended to accommodate all residents and all housing needs in our community. New housing construction is supported by new additional residential unit permissions allowing up to 3 units on properties with a single detached house, semi detached house, or townhouse. Some vacant lands that have been planned for future subdivisions have also been \u201cpre zoned\u201d to allow for residential development, minimizing costs (which get passed on to future purchasers) and supporting the creation of as many new housing units in areas of the city that have the infrastructure available to support new housing. New co living unit permissions have been added for apartment and mixed use buildings, creating opportunities for a new form of affordable housing. Through the work of the Central Kingston Growth Strategy, two areas for intensification were \u201cup zoned\u201d to accommodate much of the anticipated growth within Central Kingston in areas that are well located relative to commercial, employment, transportation and recreation opportunities. A \u2018made in Kingston\u2019 solution transformed the parking approach in ZBL 22 62 by eliminating minimum parking requirements for non residential uses and reducing minimum parking requirements for residential uses. The By law supports alternative transportation options such as car share, active transportation, and public transit through innovative and interconnected zoning provisions. The new approach continues to require essential accessible parking, and strategically supports the creation of affordable housing and the conservation of built heritage resources. For the first time, the parking approach connects directly to broader, strategic objectives such as demonstrating leadership on climate action, broadly supporting housing affordability and encouraging desirable built form in the public realm. To complement the progress in the ZBL 22 62, a new Cash in Lieu of Parking By Law will support the establishment of a city wide car sharing program where fees will support the implementation and operation of car sharing services in the City. Last, but certainly not least, ZBL 22 62 protects built heritage resources, major infrastructure, the natural heritage system and source water and helps to protects people and buildings from natural and human made hazards. We are proud of the work we have done as a community to bring this new zoning by law to fruition and look forward to seeing the many ways that it will support the future growth of our City.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/resident/garbage-recycling/waste-tools": "These tools help you sort your waste and make sure it is collected as expected.

It has a very pungent smell of mothballs due to the presence of naphthalene. Coal tar is usually regarded as a waste but has been beneficially used as a wood preservative, roofing sealant, lubricant and in therapeutic shampoos and creams to treat dandruff, psoriasis and other skin ailments. Some of the chemicals found in coal tar may be hazardous to human health or the environment if they are present in sufficiently high concentrations. Before natural gas was available in Eastern North America, coal gas was used extensively to light and heat homes and businesses. Coal gasification plants processed raw coal to produce the gas. A by product of gas production was coal tar. In 1999 and 2000 the City of Kingston spent over $2 million dollars demolishing buildings and cleaning up coal tar and other contaminants from the site of the former coal gasification works. The short answer is no. Coal tar is a thick, sticky tar material that is stuck in the cracks and joints of the limestone bedrock. It can't be pumped out because of the nature of the fractured bedrock in this area and because of the depth at which the coal tar is found. Since the clean up of the former coal gasification sites was completed in 2000, the City has been working with the Ministry of the Environment to test the deep bedrock in the downtown to determine how far underground the coal tar was able to migrate. Yes. There are three principle ways in which people can become exposed to coal tar compounds: by eating or drinking food or water that is contaminated with coal tar compounds (ingestion exposure), by getting coal tar or substances contaminated by coal tar on your skin (dermal exposure), or by breathing in vapours containing coal tar compounds (inhalation exposure). Since coal tar in Kingston's downtown is restricted to the deep bedrock groundwater, and since nobody uses water wells in this area, the only way in which people can be exposed to coal tar is by breathing in volatile coal tar vapours that might rise up and become trapped in indoor building spaces. If coal tar or coal tar compounds are not found within the deep bedrock groundwater beneath your building then there is little chance that the volatile coal tar vapours are affecting you.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/accessibility": "Kingston is a community that recognizes that people are its most valuable asset.

In Kingston, eligible work that promote restoration and preservation of designated buildings may be eligible for grants. Eligible work to designated properties that also have a heritage easement agreement registered on the property may be eligible for the City of Kingston's Heritage Property Tax Refund Program. At the municipal level, there are two types of designations under the Ontario Heritage Act \u2013 Part IV and Part V. Part IV designations refer to individual heritage properties. Part V designations refer to a grouping of heritage properties known as a Heritage Conservation District (or HCD). Under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act, municipalities may designate a grouping of properties that are of local cultural heritage value or interest to form what is known as a Heritage Conservation District. Different from individual heritage property designations which focus solely on the structures and attributes of one particular property, typically a Heritage Conservation District looks at a grouping of properties and their significance. Important vistas, plazas, streetscapes, and the historic links between these buildings and features, are also included as well as the built heritage structures and landscaping.

Other monuments honour Kingston's fallen who served in different branches of Canada's armed forces and theatres of battle. The Memorial Wall at the Veterans Memorial Garden, 303 York St. (outside the Memorial Centre) is etched with 1,022 names of Kingstonians who died in service (south side of the wall).

The Cross of Sacrifice was originally funded and commissioned by the Kingston Chapter of Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire (IODE). When the local chapter of IODE closed in the 1950s, the Princess of Wales' Own Regiment became stewards of the monument \u2013 an organization with a strong connection to the reality of military loss. As Capt. Marc Gallant, PWOR Regimental Adjutant describes it, the PWOR is \"the only agency in town at the pointy end of the spear.\" The Cross of Sacrifice is now part of the City's civic collection of artifacts, art and public memorials, making the stewardship of the monument a collaborative effort. Originally erected in memory of the Kingstonians who gave their lives in the First World War, the cenotaph now serves as a symbol of contribution and sacrifice for all of Kingston's fallen men and women. The Cross also represents the volunteerism and generosity of the IODE.

A backwater valve, also called a backflow valve, is a device used to prevent outbound water in a home\u2019s drain pipes from re entering, or \u201cbackflowing\u201d\u2014into your home. The valve has a flap that allows water to leave but closes to prevent water and/or sewage from entering. Backwater valves are designed to close the sewer line during periods of extreme rain to prevent water from entering your home. When the valve is closed you should not use any plumbing fixtures (i.e. toilets, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines) because water will not drain and will back up into your home. The Insurance Bureau of Canada recommends residents not install the plug type valves, as they allow sewer backup pressure to build beneath your basement floor, which may cause structural damage to your home. $500 to $2,000 including installation. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. Early detection of water leakage can help you quickly determine the cause and source of the leak and address it before flooding occurs. Flood alarms, also known as, flood detectors, water alarms or water detectors are electronic devices that detect the presence of water and set off an alarm when its sensors are triggered. Flood alarms come in different shapes and sizes and with a wide range of features. New models have WiFi capabilities with smart home integration. $25 to $150 Cool roofs reflect the sun\u2019s rays and reduce heat build up through a light coloured or highly reflective roofing product such as a coating, new membrane or shingle. Most roofs in Canada are dark in colour and absorb heat from the sun\u2019s rays transferring it into the rooms below. Because cool roofs are better at reflecting the sun\u2019s energy, less heat is transferred inside your home. As a result, you may not have to use your air conditioner as much, saving you energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cool roofs also increase the life expectancy of your roof, because they reflect the heat and UV rays that damage and age roof materials. Dark coloured roofs in high density areas also contribute to the urban heat island effect \u2013 significantly warmer temperatures in urban areas compared to rural areas. As a result of climate change, Kingston is expected to see dramatic increases in the number of extremely hot days due to continued global warming. Installing a cool roof is one way to help to offset this. There are cool roof options for all types of roofs, including steep slope (pitched roofs), low slope (flat roofs).. Roofing products are tested for their reflectivity and given a Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value between 0 100. The higher the number, the more reflective it is. If you want to convert an existing roof into a cool roof, you have the following options: Green roofs are living roofs. They support the growth of vegetation and consist of a waterproofing membrane, drainage layer, organic growing medium (soil), and vegetation. Green roofs capture stormwater, improve air quality and create habitats for pollinators, birds and other wildlife. Green roofs also help insulate your home in the summer and help reduce the overall temperature in Kingston. Green roof systems are generally classified as extensive, semi intensive or intensive. Your budget, vision and the structural capacity of your building will determine which type of green roof you select. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A sump pump is a small pump that is installed at the lowest part of your basement or crawlspace that prevents flooding. The sump is the low space that collects liquids, while the sump pump detects water in the sump and moves it away from your home through a network of pipes that is dug into the floor of the basement. Groundwater can easily rise through the cracks in your foundation during long periods of rain. If there is a possibility that flooding can occur in your basement or crawl space, a sump pump will collect all of this water and redirect it away from your home. There are two types of primary sump pumps available: submersible and pedestal pumps. Submersible pumps have the motor placed underwater in your sump basin, while pedestal pumps are positioned with the pump motor out of the water, above your sump basin. It is recommended that Kingston residents consider a submersible sump pump as they are the quietest, most powerful and effective sump pump. They also allow for an airtight lid that will stop debris from falling into the pit and prevent moisture and odorous air from being released into your home. $700 to $5,000, including installation.

Les prestataires d'Ontario au travail peuvent \u00e9galement b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du soutien du Programme d'aide \u00e0 la famille. Un agent d'aide au recouvrement aidera les parents recevant des prestations d'Ontario au travail et ayant la garde de leurs enfants \u00e0 obtenir, pour eux et leurs enfants, une pension alimentaire de la part de l'autre parent. Les prestataires doivent fournir \u00e0 l'agent tous les renseignements dont ils disposent pour permettre de trouver l'autre parent et l'informer si l'autre parent commence \u00e0 travailler. Ils doivent consentir un effort raisonnable pour conclure une entente concernant la pension alimentaire avec l'autre parent ou obtenir une ordonnance de pension alimentaire. Le montant de la pension alimentaire que re\u00e7oit le prestataire sera d\u00e9duit du montant de ses prestations d'Ontario au travail.

L'aide financi\u00e8re n'est habituellement accord\u00e9e que si les fun\u00e9railles, la cr\u00e9mation et l'inhumation ont lieu en Ontario.

La majorit\u00e9 des prestataires d'Ontario au travail ont r\u00e9ellement besoin des prestations et des autres formes d'aide offertes dans le cadre du programme, mais certaines personnes font de fausses d\u00e9clarations ou fournissent des renseignements non v\u00e9ridiques pour \u00eatre admissibles aux programmes d'aide. Les agents de r\u00e9vision de l'admissibilit\u00e9 d'Ontario au travail veillent \u00e0 ce que les prestataires aient r\u00e9ellement droit aux prestations qu'ils re\u00e7oivent.

Cette demande doit \u00eatre faite par \u00e9crit. La r\u00e9vision doit \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9e dans les 30 jours ouvrables suivant la r\u00e9ception de votre demande. Vous recevrez un avis \u00e9crit de la d\u00e9cision prise au terme de la r\u00e9vision interne. La d\u00e9cision peut valider, invalider ou modifier la d\u00e9cision originale.

Une aide provisoire peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'auteur d'une demande ou \u00e0 un prestataire s'il peut prouver au Tribunal qu'il \u00e9prouvera des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res durant la p\u00e9riode qui s'\u00e9coulera entre le moment o\u00f9 le Tribunal est saisi du dossier et celui o\u00f9 il rend sa d\u00e9cision. Une aide provisoire peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e seulement si la personne respecte toutes les conditions d'admissibilit\u00e9.

At this time, applicants can apply by completing the application form on the Applications page and submitting it to the City by email, mail or in person at 1211 John Counter Blvd; note that payment must be made for an application to be considered. See the Short Term Rental Licensing page for more information Who can apply for a short term rental operator licence? Only the owner of the property or the authorized agent of the owner may apply for a licence. The Owner's authorized agent means the person or persons appointed by the Owner to make decisions in relation to the Owner's property in their absence. If the Owner is a corporation or partnership, they have the authority to bind the Owner. Who is required to have a short term rental operator licence in Kingston? Any owner of a property within the City of Kingston who receive payment for all or part of a dwelling unit used to provide sleeping accommodations for a period equal to or less than 30 consecutive days. Where in Kingston are short term rentals allowed? As of June 1, 2021, short term rentals are allowed in Residential Dwelling Units, including single detached, semi detached, row house, secondary suites in a single detached dwelling, or multi unit buildings located within the City of Kingston as per section 7 of the bylaw. How long does it take to process an application for a short term rental licence? Applications are typically reviewed within 10 business days of application; however, processing times can vary based on the information provided in the application form. Each application is reviewed to ensure the applicant meets the requirements of the Short Term Rental Licensing Bylaw. What type of dwelling is considered a short term rental? Any existing Dwelling Unit, or portions thereof, could be operated as a short term rental once a licence has been approved. A Dwelling Unit means a suite operated as a housekeeping unit, used or intended to be used by one or more persons and usually containing cooking, eating, living, sleeping and sanitary facilities. This definition applies to any Dwelling Unit in any type of building, including a single detached, semi detached or row house with a secondary suite within the principal building or a detached building on the same lot; as well as a seasonal dwelling unit (cabin/cottage). What type of building or space would not be considered for a short term rental? Where cooking, eating, living/sleeping and sanitary facilities are not provided (for example a Bunkie used for sleeping only), this would not be considered a Dwelling Unit. A Short Term Rental means all or part of a Dwelling Unit used to provide sleeping accommodations for a period equal to or less than thirty consecutive days in exchange for payment and includes a Bed and Breakfast. Every short term rental must be part of a dwelling unit as defined by having cooking, eating, living/sleeping and sanitary/washroom facilities. No completely separate sleeping space only is permitted to have a licence to operate. What is considered a separate dwelling unit or secondary suite? A dwelling unit containing living/sleeping, eating and sanitary facilities that is completely separated from the principal dwelling unit by a fire separation and door that restricts entry between the two units would be considered a separate dwelling unit or secondary suite. A bar area in a basement would not constitute a separate unit. What do I do if the Dwelling Unit being proposed for my short term rental does not have a unit number? If your dwelling unit does not have a recognized unit number by the City and you have more than one unit in your building, it may not necessarily mean the unit is illegal. Please contact building services at buildinginspection@cityofkingston.ca. We will check historic records to determine if the unit was legalized previously, however no unit number was assigned at that time. If this is the case, we will work with civic addressing to have the unit recognized and a unit number assigned. What can I do prior to my application submission to ensure approval? It is always good to confirm if the unit you will be renting is legal and there are no open permits on file that may extend the time for the short term rental application to be approved. Staff are available at buildinginspection@cityofkingston.ca to review information on file with you prior to your short term license application submission to help with the process. How many persons or number of bedrooms are permitted for my building type to licence my short term rental? Your Short Term Rental licence permits you to rent the following building types and units/persons associated as per 7.1 and 7.2 or the below as shown in the below chart. An Operator shall not hold more than one Licence and shall not operate or permit the operation of more than two Short term Rentals at any time as per 5.2 of the Bylaw. 7. Regulations 7.1. Subject to Section 7.2 below, a Short Term Rental shall have: 7.2. Section 7.1 of this Bylaw does not apply to a Short Term Rental that consists of an entire single detached Dwelling Unit rented under a single booking. Will I be notified if an agent wants to inspect my proposed short term rental space to confirm application information? Any City staff wanting to inspect your property to confirm by law compliance will contact you and set up a time that is convenient. An agent cannot enter a dwelling unit without consent of the occupier, unless an order or warrant has been issued authorizing entry, or there is an immediate danger to the health and safety of persons. Refusal of consent to allow entry to a dwelling unit does not constitute hindering or obstruction under the STR Bylaw unless the City is acting under an order or warrant, noted above, under the Municipal Act. What can I do if my application or licence has been denied, revoked or suspended? Where a licence has been refused, suspended, or revoked, a written decision will be provided to the applicant, and the applicant, within 15 days of being notified may appeal to the Appeals Committee for a review of the decision by submitting the appeal to cityclerk@cityofkingston.ca on the prescribed form, and pay an appeal fee of $318.25. Applicants will be provided a date for the appeals committee meeting which generally take place the third Monday of each month. There will be time given for each side to prepare evidence prior to the hearing. The Appeals Committee can only review a decision based on the bylaw only and cannot hear or make decisions on building code, planning act, or fire code matters. No refunds are provided even if the decision is in favour of the applicant as the fee covers the cost associated. Will rural residents hoping to operate a short term rental be required to upgrade their septic systems to support a short term rental? No, if your dwelling unit is existing and you are not adding any additional plumbing fixtures or living space to support the short term rental use. In certain instances, where an additional dwelling unit has been constructed without a permit, a building permit and zoning approvals would be required to utilize this space as a Dwelling Unit or Short Term Rental. In these circumstances, the septic system would need to be assessed to support any additional loads imposed. Are renovations required to my home in order to operate a short term rental? In general, existing homes that are compliant with the Building Code and Zoning Bylaw would not require renovations or additional construction. If your existing unit was created legally under a building permit, no alterations would be required in order to operate your short term rental. If you are considering renovations, such as finishing a basement, adding bedrooms or an additional Dwelling Unit including a secondary suite, in order to rent out the space, a building permit would be required. Are there any fire safety regulations applicable to operating my short term rental? All existing dwelling units in Ontario, regardless if they are a short term rental or not, are subject to the Fire Code which states: If I operate a short term rental, does the Municipal Accommodation Tax apply? The Municipal Accommodation Tax Bylaw (2018 95) was approved by Council in June 2018 and amended in January 2021. This bylaw applies the 4% MAT to all short term rental (for a period equal to or less than thirty consecutive days per booking) and collection came into effect on June 1, 2021. The process is currently being updated and when ready you can access information and learn more by visiting the Municipal Accommodation Tax page. How do I submit my Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT) for qualifying stays? We are currently working on an integrated system that will allow payments to be paid through the City\u2019s online portal associated with your short term rental licence. This will be available on the City website in July 2022. How and when do I need to renew my Short Term Rental License? Short Term Rental Licenses are required to be renewed annually, on the anniversary of the initial license issuance. A separate renewal license application has been created to allow a more streamlined approach to the initial application where the short term rental information previously submitted has not changed. What do I do if I have a concern with my neighbour\u2019s short term rental? Please contact the Licensing Department by phone at 613 546 4291 ext 3150, by email, or in person at 1211 John Counter Blvd. to submit a complaint. The matter will be directed to the City\u2019s Licencing and Bylaw Enforcement departments for investigation. All properties within the City of Kingston are subject to the minimum standards established by the Property Standards Bylaw (2005 100), which manages and controls the way properties are maintained and used in the City of Kingston. The purpose of this bylaw is to set out standards for properties, so they are not an eyesore or nuisance to neighbours or affect the enjoyment of one\u2019s own property.

Families living in the City of Kingston or County of Frontenac who need help with the cost of licensed child care for their children (up to 12 years of age) can apply for a child care subsidy if they meet eligibility requirements. The Childcare Subsidy program may cover all, or part, of eligible families' childcare costs. The amount of subsidy provided is determined by an income test. To assess family income, applicants are required to provide a copy of their most recent Notice of Assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency. Every day, early childhood educators (ECEs) provide Ontario\u2019s children with safe, responsive, and caring interactions that build a strong foundation for their development and well being.

(The almost in this case refers to a limited number of properties that have old permissions under the former zoning by laws). While Council approved the new Kingston Zoning By law Number 2022 62 (ZBL 22 62) at a special meeting on April 26, two appeals were submitted to the Ontario Land Tribunal, which held up the entire by law. At a settlement hearing on September 28, the Ontario Land Tribunal issued an oral decision confirming that the vast majority of the by law is in effect (all portions that are not under appeal). In harmonizing, simplifying, and modernizing the zoning provisions, ZBL 22 62 supports new economic development through simplified and flexible definitions that encourage new industries and business innovations to thrive across the city. Home occupation permissions allow for flexible business opportunities while still ensuring that residential neighbourhoods maintain their planned function. New complementary use permissions have been added for places of worship and new rules support schools, recognizing the importance of these community facilities in our neighbourhoods. ZBL 22 62 supports a more vibrant, healthy, and diversified rural area by protecting our most important agricultural resources while expanding the range of agricultural uses and allowing for new agri tourism uses. It supports on farm diversified uses and agriculture related uses, and focuses rural growth to the hamlets. It also introduces new permissions for \u201crural uses\u201d, seasonal cabins and bunkhouses, providing new opportunities and ways for our residents and tourists to our area to enjoy rural lands. Residential permissions of ZBL 22 62 are inclusive and focused on equitable housing opportunities for all people. The rules focus on land use impacts and are intended to accommodate all residents and all housing needs in our community. New housing construction is supported by new additional residential unit permissions allowing up to 3 units on properties with a single detached house, semi detached house, or townhouse. Some vacant lands that have been planned for future subdivisions have also been \u201cpre zoned\u201d to allow for residential development, minimizing costs (which get passed on to future purchasers) and supporting the creation of as many new housing units in areas of the city that have the infrastructure available to support new housing. New co living unit permissions have been added for apartment and mixed use buildings, creating opportunities for a new form of affordable housing. Through the work of the Central Kingston Growth Strategy, two areas for intensification were \u201cup zoned\u201d to accommodate much of the anticipated growth within Central Kingston in areas that are well located relative to commercial, employment, transportation and recreation opportunities. A \u2018made in Kingston\u2019 solution transformed the parking approach in ZBL 22 62 by eliminating minimum parking requirements for non residential uses and reducing minimum parking requirements for residential uses. The By law supports alternative transportation options such as car share, active transportation, and public transit through innovative and interconnected zoning provisions. The new approach continues to require essential accessible parking, and strategically supports the creation of affordable housing and the conservation of built heritage resources. For the first time, the parking approach connects directly to broader, strategic objectives such as demonstrating leadership on climate action, broadly supporting housing affordability and encouraging desirable built form in the public realm. To complement the progress in the ZBL 22 62, a new Cash in Lieu of Parking By Law will support the establishment of a city wide car sharing program where fees will support the implementation and operation of car sharing services in the City. Last, but certainly not least, ZBL 22 62 protects built heritage resources, major infrastructure, the natural heritage system and source water and helps to protects people and buildings from natural and human made hazards. We are proud of the work we have done as a community to bring this new zoning by law to fruition and look forward to seeing the many ways that it will support the future growth of our City.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/community-services/fr/ontario-works/": "Le programme Ontario au travail offre une aide financi\u00e8re provisoire aux r\u00e9sidents de la ville de Kingston et du comt\u00e9 de Frontenac qui en ont le plus besoin et qui ont entrepris des d\u00e9marches visant \u00e0 se trouver un emploi et \u00e0 le conserver.

Les prestataires d'Ontario au travail peuvent \u00e9galement b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du soutien du Programme d'aide \u00e0 la famille. Un agent d'aide au recouvrement aidera les parents recevant des prestations d'Ontario au travail et ayant la garde de leurs enfants \u00e0 obtenir, pour eux et leurs enfants, une pension alimentaire de la part de l'autre parent. Les prestataires doivent fournir \u00e0 l'agent tous les renseignements dont ils disposent pour permettre de trouver l'autre parent et l'informer si l'autre parent commence \u00e0 travailler. Ils doivent consentir un effort raisonnable pour conclure une entente concernant la pension alimentaire avec l'autre parent ou obtenir une ordonnance de pension alimentaire. Le montant de la pension alimentaire que re\u00e7oit le prestataire sera d\u00e9duit du montant de ses prestations d'Ontario au travail. La Ville offre une aide financi\u00e8re au nom des r\u00e9sidentes et r\u00e9sidents d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s dont la succession est insuffisante sur le plan financier pour couvrir les frais de fun\u00e9railles, de cr\u00e9mation et d'inhumation de base. Les Services sociaux et de logement paient les frais demand\u00e9s par un salon fun\u00e9raire ou un cimeti\u00e8re afin que celui ci fournisse ces services conform\u00e9ment aux tarifs que le conseil municipal a approuv\u00e9s. L'aide financi\u00e8re n'est habituellement accord\u00e9e que si les fun\u00e9railles, la cr\u00e9mation et l'inhumation ont lieu en Ontario. Pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez consulter la page Aide financi\u00e8re pour les fun\u00e9railles, la cr\u00e9mation et l'inhumation. La majorit\u00e9 des prestataires d'Ontario au travail ont r\u00e9ellement besoin des prestations et des autres formes d'aide offertes dans le cadre du programme, mais certaines personnes font de fausses d\u00e9clarations ou fournissent des renseignements non v\u00e9ridiques pour \u00eatre admissibles aux programmes d'aide. Les agents de r\u00e9vision de l'admissibilit\u00e9 d'Ontario au travail veillent \u00e0 ce que les prestataires aient r\u00e9ellement droit aux prestations qu'ils re\u00e7oivent. Il est possible de d\u00e9noncer un cas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 de fraude en mati\u00e8re d'aide sociale des quatre fa\u00e7ons suivantes : Le personnel est li\u00e9 par les exigences en mati\u00e8re d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'information et de protection de la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Loi sur l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'information et la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e et ne peut pas communiquer de renseignements au sujet d'une enqu\u00eate sur des actes frauduleux \u00e0 la personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte.

Cette demande doit \u00eatre faite par \u00e9crit. La r\u00e9vision doit \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9e dans les 30 jours ouvrables suivant la r\u00e9ception de votre demande. Vous recevrez un avis \u00e9crit de la d\u00e9cision prise au terme de la r\u00e9vision interne. La d\u00e9cision peut valider, invalider ou modifier la d\u00e9cision originale. Si vous n'\u00eates pas d'accord avec la d\u00e9cision prise au terme de la r\u00e9vision interne, vous pouvez faire appel de cette d\u00e9cision dans les 30 jours aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal de l'aide sociale, un organisme ind\u00e9pendant dont les membres sont nomm\u00e9s par le gouvernement provincial. Vous pouvez vous procurer des formulaires de demande \u00e0 votre bureau r\u00e9gional. Les formulaires remplis doivent \u00eatre envoy\u00e9s par la poste \u00e0 l'adresse suivante : Tribunal de l'aide sociale 1075, rue Bay, 7e \u00e9tage Toronto (Ontario) M5S 2B1 Num\u00e9ro sans frais : 1 800 753 3895 Les d\u00e9cisions prises au terme de la r\u00e9vision interne concernant une prestation discr\u00e9tionnaire sont d\u00e9finitives, il n'est donc pas possible d'interjeter appel aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal de l'aide sociale dans ces cas. Une aide provisoire peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'auteur d'une demande ou \u00e0 un prestataire s'il peut prouver au Tribunal qu'il \u00e9prouvera des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res durant la p\u00e9riode qui s'\u00e9coulera entre le moment o\u00f9 le Tribunal est saisi du dossier et celui o\u00f9 il rend sa d\u00e9cision. Une aide provisoire peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e seulement si la personne respecte toutes les conditions d'admissibilit\u00e9. Si l'appel est rejet\u00e9 ou retir\u00e9, l'aide provisoire consentie sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme des prestations auxquelles la personne n'avait pas droit. Si l'appel est accord\u00e9 et que la personne a re\u00e7u des prestations d'aide provisoire d'un montant sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 ce qui est pr\u00e9vu dans l'ordonnance, le montant d\u00e9passant la somme \u00e0 laquelle cette personne a droit sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un paiement lui ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 en trop. * en anglais seulement 362, rue Montr\u00e9al Kingston (Ontario) K7K 3H5 Heures d'ouverture : lundi  vendredi, de 8 h 30 \u00e0 16 h 30 View Larger Map", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/emergency-services/emergency-management/flooding": "Cataraqui Conservation is responsible for monitoring and issuing updates on water levels in the Kingston area. You can find information about flood forecasting and warning on their website. Residents are also encouraged to visit www.Ontario.ca/flooding. If a flood should occur, are you ready to respond? The City's Office of Emergency Management provides guidance on how to prepare, respond and recover from a flooding event. Avoid driving on flooded roads as excessive water may prevent your brakes from working. If you must drive through a flooded stretch of road, Ontario's Ministry of Transportation recommends that you test your brakes in advance when it is safe to do so by stopping quickly and firmly at 50 km/h. Make sure the vehicle stops in a straight line, without pulling to one side. The brake pedal should feel firm and secure. If you still feel a pulling to one side or a spongy brake pedal even after the brakes are dry, you should take the vehicle in for repair immediately. During a flood clean up, supervise children and pets and keep them out of the area until clean up has been completed. Remember to always keep children within arm's reach when around water. Large debris, construction materials and demolition waste that are too heavy or too large to be packaged with household trash will not be collected in regular garbage. These items can be taken to any of the following waste transfer locations. Note: a fee for disposal is typically charged based on weight. Items that are recyclable can be placed in grey or blue boxes with other household recyclables for curbside pickup. More information on blue boxes, grey boxes, household hazardous waste, the Kingston and Area Recycling Centre; electronic waste; tires; and scrap metal can be found on the City's recycling page.

If the humidity is periodic or confined to one room, a portable unit is sufficient. Whole house units $1,000 \u2013 $2,000+; portable units $150 \u2013 $300. Source: Natural Resources Canada Heating water accounts for up to 20 per cent of a home\u2019s energy use, making it the second highest energy consumer after space heating. Drain water heat recovery systems capture the heat from water going down a drain, typically the shower, and use it to heat cold water entering your water heater. It\u2019s particularly effective when there are simultaneous water flows i.e. when you\u2019re using hot water in the shower at the same time that water is flowing down the drain. $550 \u2013 $1,700 plus installation.

High efficiency gas furnaces are quiet, reliable, and effective at maintaining a comfortable home, and they can reduce your energy bill by up to 45 per cent. An ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified forced air furnace, fueled by gas uses 6 per cent less energy, fueled by oil uses 9 per cent less energy, on average than a standard model. Space heating represents more than half of your home\u2019s energy use and offers the most potential for reducing your energy bill. If your furnace was installed before 1990, it\u2019s probably a lower efficiency model, as regulations for furnaces in Canada have been updated since then. If you upgrade to an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified furnace, you will save money and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases you emit. $2,000 \u2013 $8,000.

For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation.

A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air. Choose an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ductless heating and cooling system to cut your electrical heating bill by up to 60 per cent, and your cooling bill by 30 per cent, depending on your climate. $2,500 to $5,000+ per unit, including installation.

If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures. Ground source heating produce less CO2 than other forms of space heating systems. $20,000 \u2013 $40,000, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Homes built after 1977 are typically more airtight, which helps to prevent heat loss but also prevents air circulation, which is important for your health and comfort. Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems.

Water heaters with storage tanks are the most common in Canadian homes, but they are not the most energy efficient. Electricity, gas or oil is used to heat water stored in the tank and supply it, as needed, to household fixtures and appliances. Storage tanks typically hold between 113 and 378 litres of water in their tanks, and this water is continuously reheated and kept hot 24 hours a day. $800 to $1,500, plus installation.

In 2017, the City of Kingston completed the revitalization of Victoria Park that included the addition of a new splash pad, tennis and basketball courts and a BBQ/picnic zone that enhances the space for the community to come together to meet, talk and play. This work was led by staff from Recreation & Leisure Services and the planning process coincided with the development of the Public Art Master Plan and Public Art Policy, which resulted in this park renewal project offering an opportunity for the City to pursue the commissioning of its first large scale permanent public art installation in over forty years. A jury that included two Kingston based artists and two Victoria Park community members have selected the work \u2018Horse and Cart\u2019 by Nicholas Crombach as the winning proposal for the Victoria Park Public Art Project. This process was facilitated by the City in keeping with the Public Art Policy as approved. Art type: Permanent Budget: $55,000 Location: Victoria Park Installation was completed June 3, 2021. Horse and Cart consists of a children\u2019s wooden horse cart and a life sized horse, depicting a toy transforming into a full sized horse and buggy. Inspired by the horse and buggy era when Victoria Park was first established, the sculpture \u2013 which measures 15 ft in length and 7.5 ft in height \u2013 aims to enliven local history and to engage the imagination of park visitors through its amusing, familiar imagery. Shaped with research into Williamsville\u2019s history, \u201cHorse and Cart\u201d also mirrors the history of Victoria Park itself: it was once a plot of farmland, which was granted to the City of Kingston for the purpose of developing a park for recreational enjoyment, and leisure activities. Nicholas Crombach is based in Kingston, Ontario and has exhibited in Ontario, Quebec and across North America and Europe. Crombach\u2019s sculptural work engages subject matter derived from styles and motifs attributed to the fine and decorative arts and traditional crafts of past eras. Crombach creates contemporary confrontations by disrupting these historical references through the addition of playful and unexpected materials, details, and gestures. The commissioning of the Victoria Park Public Art Project involved a two phase procurement process including a Request for Information (RFI) that was issued in April 2018 and closed in May 2018 and a Request for Proposal (RFP) that was issued in October 2018 and closed in May 2019. To support the artists through the RFP process and to ensure transparency within and awareness of the Public Art Program, staff held a public engagement session at the Memorial Centre on April 13, 2019 where members of the community were invited to meet the shortlisted artists, view their proposals, and provide feedback. This feedback was gathered by staff and provided back to the shortlisted artists who used this information to refine their proposals. A jury comprised of two Kingston based artists Jocelyn Purdie and Teresa Carlesimo and two Victoria Park community members Joanne Thompson and Ulrike Bender reviewed all submissions and shortlisted four artists and one artist collective to respond to the RFP. The jury evaluated the five proposals based on artistic excellence and creativity of approach, compliance with the objectives and requirements, appropriateness to the site and community context, maintenance and conservation requirements, budget, timeline, technical feasibility and probability of success, experience on similar projects, including reference feedback, and Accessibility Standards for Customer Service, Ontario Reg. 429/7.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/-/share-your-input-shortlisted-artists-present-proposals-for-art-at-victoria-park": "Share your input: shortlisted artists present proposals for art at Victoria Park April 1, 2019  Five artists have been shortlisted for the Victoria Park public art project as part of the City of Kingston's Public Art Program.

The Planning Act, the Heritage Act and the Municipal Act all contain provisions governing the development review process, how land uses are be controlled and who controls land development and uses the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) requires all land use planning decisions to be consistent with provincial policy. Land use policies and development requirements are set out in the City's Official Plan and Zoning Bylaws. The Planning Act requires a Municipality to have an Official Plan. An Official Plan guides City Council in its decisions about how lands in the City should be used and how growth and change should occur over a 20 year horizon. Zoning Bylaws implement the policies in the Official Plan. Zoning Bylaws contain specific provisions to regulate the use of land, lot sizes and lot development standards. If a development proposal does not conform to the requirements of the Zoning Bylaw, a building permit cannot be issued. Information about the City's Official Plan and Zoning Bylaws and copies of the documents can be obtained at the City's Planning & Development Department, located at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. The Planning & Development Department is responsible for reviewing and providing a recommendation to Council regarding development applications. The timely processing of applications requires co operation from and co ordination with numerous internal and external stakeholders, including the applicant. The development review process includes the following main steps. Not all steps are required for every application \u2013 for example, for some applications there is no requirement for a public meeting, and in some cases, the approval authority has been delegated by Council to staff. Please select a heading from the following menu for more information: The City welcomes and encourages comments regarding the development review process. Council's adopted priorities include an emphasis on customer service excellence, building an \"open for business\" culture, and enhancing service by streamlining the development review process. There are many ongoing customer service initiatives related to the development review process. The following Council Report 12 268 provides information about the status of these initiatives. The Final Report of the Mayor's Task Force on Development also outlines a number of recommendations for improving the City's development review process. Required forms and information: Pre application meetings are a mandatory part of the development review process for applications for Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw Amendments, Site Plan Control, and Draft Plans of Subdivision and Condominium. Pre application for Committee of Adjustment applications (consents and minor variances) is arranged with the Planner assigned to deal with these applications. Please contact the planner of the day by calling 613 546 4291 ext. 3180. Pre application meetings are held every third Tuesday morning at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. View the meeting schedule. At the Pre application meeting you will meet with staff from City departments (e.g. Planning, Building & Licensing, Engineering and Utilities Kingston) and external agencies (e.g. Conservation Authority). At the meeting, the required approvals, supporting studies (e.g. traffic impact, tree preservation, stormwater management, parking, noise), drawings and other information to be submitted with an application will be identified. Any technical issues that will need to be addressed will also be identified. The submission requirements and application fees will be confirmed by the assigned Planner on the Development Application Pre Application Meeting  Study and Plan Identification List) that is provided to you following the meeting. While the intent of the pre application meeting is to identify all requirements related to the proposal, on occasion additional information/studies may be required based on staff's review of your formal application submission and further project details. Proposals discussed at pre application are confidential until a formal application is submitted. The City no longer accepts paper based applications \u2013 we have gone digital using DASH! All planning applications are now made through our DASH portal. Links to tutorials and guides are also available to assist users with making their application. Planning staff are always available to provide assistance with submissions at the customer service counter at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. For all applications the following information must be provided in order for the application to be submitted through DASH: Note: Planning, Building & Licensing Services collects the Planning and Engineering fees as part of the initial application submission. Some external agencies (e.g. Conservation Authority and Health Unit also charge fees for reviewing development applications and you are responsible for paying those fees directly to the commenting agency. The assigned Planner will review the completed application form and accompanying information to determine if the application is complete. The processing of an application may be delayed until all required information has been submitted. Poor quality plans and supporting reports or incomplete information submissions will result in delays in the processing of an application. If you have any questions regarding the studies or supporting information that is required for a complete application you should contact the Planner assigned to your file at pre application. When your application has been reviewed and it is confirmed that your submission includes all the required information, a Letter of Complete Application will be provided to you. While the municipality has 30 days under the Planning Act to make this determination, it is done as soon as possible. If the application is not complete, a Letter of Incomplete Application will be provided to you outlining the additional information, reports or studies that are required. If you disagree with the City's assessment of the completeness of the application you should contact the assigned planner to discuss this. If agreement is not reached, the Planning Act provides 30 days for you to make a motion to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal for a determination on the matter and the Tribunal's decision is final. When all required information has been submitted, a Letter of Complete Application will be issued. The City is required to provide a Notice of Complete Application within 15 days after the Letter of Complete Application has been issued for Official Plan, Zoning Amendments and Plans of Subdivision. Whenever possible, the City combines the Public Notice of Complete Application and the Public Meeting Notice (discussed further below), provided that the notice requirements for both can be met. If that is not possible, then the Notice of Complete Application will be given separately in order to meet the legislative requirements, and the Notice of the Public Meeting will be given later. Any timelines mandated by the Planning Act for a decision on your application(s) start once an application has been deemed complete. For some applications (Site Plan Control and Committee of Adjustment) the timeline starts upon receipt of the application and required information, but there is no requirement to issue a notice of complete application. The planner assigned to your file will circulate your application together with the appropriate plans and studies to various City departments and external agencies, typically within 5 working days from complete application receipt. Depending on the application type and location of the property, the circulation list may include City Council, the District Councillor, municipal departments (e.g. Planning, Building & Licensing, Engineering, Utilities Kingston, Parks, Fire & Rescue, Transportation, etc.), external agencies (Kingston Economic Development Corporation, Conservation Authority, Health Unit), school boards, abutting municipalities (e.g. Loyalist Township, South Frontenac Township), utility companies (e.g. Hydro One, Bell, Cogeco, Union Gas, Trans Canada Pipelines), railway companies, provincial ministries (e.g. Municipal Affairs, Housing, Environment and Climate Change, Natural Resources and Forestry) and federal departments (e.g. Parks Canada, Fisheries and Oceans, Canada Post). Responses to the initial technical circulation are required within 10 working days from the date of circulation (30 days for plans of subdivision) and within five working days for subsequent circulations (15 days for plans of subdivision). Responses received are reviewed and consolidated by the assigned Planner, The Planner also provides comments based on their review of the technical comments and planning policy and site design. These comments are forwarded to you and/or your agent. Where there are a significant number of responses, a meeting may be arranged with you and / or your agent to review the comments to ensure there is an understanding of the issues and any additional information to be provided. You are then responsible to respond to the staff / agency comments and submit any required additional information and revised drawings to the assigned Planner, who then re circulates the material to the appropriate departments / external agencies. As needed, the assigned Planner will also work with you and arrange meetings with departments or external agencies to address technical comments or concerns. Complete re submissions that address all of the technical responses are key to enabling the various departments / agencies to fully review the revised drawings and updated information in the context of their previous comments and provide a response within the requested time frame. This process of applicant submission, City review / comment and applicant re submission continues until such time as all departments / agencies have signed off on the proposal. Approval of applications for Site Plan Control, Final Plan of Subdivision and Consent has been delegated by Council to staff. However, the procedures governing Council's delegated authority provide for a \"bump up\" to a Committee or Council for final approval. In the case of an application for Site Plan Control or Final Subdivision approval, Council is circulated the applications and a motion of Council is required to \"bump up\" the application to Planning Committee or Council respectively. Where a Consent application is \"disputed\", the application is referred to the Committee of Adjustment. The procedures also provide that staff or the applicant can also request a \"bump up\". This could occur if you disagreed with one or more of the municipal conditions of approval or where there is disagreement between staff and the applicant respecting required works. If there is a \"bump up\" request, the timelines for processing the application will be impacted given the need for preparation of a staff report to the applicable Committee or Council and consideration of the application at a Committee or Council meeting. The Planning Act requires that at least one public meeting be held for applications for Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw amendments, Draft Plans of Subdivision / Condominium and Committee of Adjustment applications (\"disputed\" consents and minor variances). The Act sets out the notice procedures (form, content and timing) and the people to be notified. Where applications are being processed concurrently, one consolidated public meeting will be held for all the applications. The City provides formal notice of the public meeting by both first class mail and the posting of signage on the subject lands. You are responsible for preparing and/or installing the required sign in accordance with the City's signage specifications. Courtesy notice is also posted on the City's website and is included on the City page of the newspaper. Where the matter affects large areas or the entire municipality, Notice is published in the newspaper. Notice of the public meeting must be given: There is no requirement to hold a public meeting or provide formal public notice for Site Plan Control (SPC) applications, applications for Final Subdivision / Condominium approval, or applications to Lift Part Lot Control and Remove a Holding Symbol. The City's procedures require that a sign is posted on the property for Site Plan Control and Committee of Adjustment applications. For these applications you will be provided with a sign to post on the property by the planner assigned to your file. The Planning Committee typically meets on the 1st and 3rd Thursdays of each month and the Committee of Adjustment meets the 4th Monday of each month. At the public meeting, you or your agent are expected to make a presentation describing the proposed development, summarizing any key studies and reports and providing the rationale for the applications. Staff may then supply any supplementary information as well as a brief summary of any public input received. Committee members may ask you questions for clarification. Interested members of the public may make written submissions to the Committee or appear before the Committee to comment on the application or ask questions. Once all public input has been received, you or your agent is given an opportunity to respond to the comments and summarize the application. After this, the public meeting is closed. In some cases an application may be amended following the public meeting in response to technical comments or issues identified by the public or the Committee. Depending on the nature of the changes, a second public meeting may be required. A second public meeting could also be required if the notice for the public meeting was not provided properly. Following the public meeting, Planning Committee, at a second Planning Committee Meeting, will consider a comprehensive report and make its recommendation to Council. Following the public portion of a Committee of Adjustment meeting, the Committee discusses and makes a recommendation on the application. Following the public meeting, the assigned Planner will prepare a comprehensive report to Planning Committee. This report will include an analysis of the proposed development and the applicable policies and bylaws, a summary of submitted reports or studies, a discussion of the issues raised in any of the technical responses and at the public meeting (including any specific matters identified by Committee members), and a recommendation to the Committee whether the application should be approved or rejected. If the comprehensive report recommends approval of the application, any conditions to the approval will be included (e.g. conditions of draft plan approval) together with a draft of the proposed Amending Bylaws (Official Plan and / or Zoning Bylaw). The draft conditions and amending by laws will be circulated to you and your agent for review and comment prior to finalizing the report. The time required to prepare the Comprehensive Report will depend on the complexity of the project, the type of application, the nature of public input received, any identified technical matters, and the need for any additional information from the applicant. In some cases, particularly for large developments or ones that have become controversial, the City may require some of the supporting studies to be peer reviewed. A peer review is an independent review of the study submitted by a qualified professional in that field of study. Typically studies such as market impact or environmental impact studies for large developments are peer reviewed. You are responsible for the cost of the peer review. Once the comprehensive report is drafted by the assigned Planner, it is reviewed/approved by management staff in Planning, Building & Licensing and then forwarded to the Commissioner of Community Services. The report is then submitted to the clerks department for inclusion on the Planning Committee agenda. All reports are also reviewed/signed by the Chief Administrative Officer. Some reports may also require sign off by other Commissioners. The comprehensive report and recommendations will be considered during a regular meeting of the Planning Committee. During the Planning Committee's discussion of the application, questions may be directed to staff respecting the report or recommendations and members of the public will have the opportunity to provide oral comments. The Committee may recommend to City Council that the application be approved with or without changes to the staff recommendation and draft Bylaws or that the application be denied. In some cases, based on the Committee's discussion, the application may be deferred or referred back to staff until additional information is received, either from you or staff. Planning Committee's recommendations are forwarded to City Council for approval. The Planning Committee Report is considered by Council in open session and Council may adopt the Committee's recommendation, amend it, reject it or refer it back to the Planning Committee or staff for further consideration / information. If an application is approved by City Council, the amending Bylaw respecting Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw amendments will be given all three readings and passed at that City Council meeting or a Draft Plan of Subdivision may be approved . After the Committee of Adjustment or City Council makes a decision on an application, the Planning Act requires that Notice of that decision be issued. The Act prescribes the form of the Notice, the timing for issuing the Notice, and the persons to whom the Notice must be given. For Committee of Adjustment applications, Notice respecting a minor variance application must be given not later than ten days after the decision is made, and for consent applications, within 15 days after the decision is made. The Notice includes information on the approved variances and land severance together with any conditions imposed by the Committee. The Notice also sets out the final day for any appeals to be submitted. For all Committee of Adjustment decisions, the City typically provides Notice within 2 3 days following the decision. For applications for Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw amendments and Draft Plans of Subdivision / Condominium, Council must give Notice within 15 days from the date of the decision or passing of the amending Bylaw. The Notice of Adoption (Official Plan amendment), Notice of Passing (Zoning Bylaw amendment) and Notice of Decision (Draft Plan) include information on the Bylaw amendments (location, purpose and effect) as well as the conditions of draft plan approval. The Notice also sets out the final day for any appeals to be submitted. In most cases, the City provides the required Notice within 7 \u2013 10 days following the decision. If no appeals to the Committee / Council decisions are received, the decisions are final and come into effect. The Planning Act provides for an appeal process for decisions on planning applications. Any person with an interest in the matter may appeal a decision of the Committee of Adjustment or Council to the Ontario Land Tribunal provided that they made a presentation at the public meeting or provided a written submission prior to the decision being made. The appeal must be filed within the appeal period as set out in the Notice and must identify the portion of the decision being appealed and the reasons why. If an application is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the final decision will be made following a Tribunal Hearing. For more information on the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, refer to the Citizens' Guide created by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. You can apply for your building permit at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. A building permit is your formal permission to begin construction or demolition. It means that the City of Kingston has reviewed the plans for any new structure, addition or renovation. Your plans must comply with the Ontario Building Code, local Zoning Bylaws, and other applicable laws and regulations. At the building permit stage the City will collect the applicable development charges and impost fees. Building permits regulate the type of construction allowed and help to ensure building standards are met. The building permit process protects your interests, as well as those of the community and helps to ensure that any structural change is safe, legal and sound. By obtaining a permit, you can also take advantage of the professional expertise of Building Division staff. Inspectors are good sources of information and can offer suggestions to help solve construction problems, often before they occur. Even if your designer or contractor obtains the permit on your behalf, you are ultimately responsible for complying with all building requirements.

The City of Kingston, in partnership with Tourism Kingston, has recently unveiled a unique and public installation designed by local architecture firm, RAW Design Inc. (RAW). Titled Water Snake, this is a playful, interactive installation designed to delight and engage residents and visitors along Kingston\u2019s waterfront. Water Snake is nestled along the pathway between the Delta Hotel and Battery Park and is an experiment in animating an underdeveloped space in a semi permanent way through a combination of design and technology, involving innovative and sustainable 3D printing done by local company, Nidus3D. The installation features three distinct sculptural segments that offer seating and that also encourage play and interaction. It is meant to help create a sense of place and to propose new ways of thinking about public spaces and how we use them. The installation is animated by a ground mural artwork created by local artist, Jenny Moring. This project is supported by funding from the Canada Community Revitalization Fund. Participants are encouraged to document their artwork and share on social media platforms using the hashtag  YGKStreetArtWall.

Paved Paradise is a temporary public art project that features the work of Kingston based artists on seven pedestrian level billboards at the corner of Ontario and Brock Streets, adjacent to City Hall in downtown Kingston. The project was created in 2018 as a response to a Council directive to \u2018beautify\u2019 a city parking lot at Brock and Ontario streets. Paved Paradise is an important temporary public art platform that provides local emerging artists with a medium scale opportunity to exhibit a body of work that responds to a project goal or theme. Through this exhibition platform, the selected artists who work primarily in 2 dimensional mediums (drawing, illustration, photography, graphic arts) have an opportunity to translate their work to a larger scale public facing exhibition. This is the first artistic collaboration between Lee Stewart and Bree Rappaport. Both are Kingston based artists. Lee Stewart was born and raised in Kashechewan, a small remote reserve on James Bay in northern Ontario. He spent years in the Rideau Lakes region, and studied film and art history at Carleton University in Ottawa. He then lived in Vancouver before returning to establish himself in Kingston. Stewart\u2019s cultural influences are as vast as his lived experience, without hierarchy or elevated status. As a self taught artist, Stewart\u2019s experimentation, innate curiosity, and openness continue to shape his evolving style. Bree Rappaport holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Ontario College of Art and Design University. While in school, she pursued projects around social and environmental justice, community economic development, and art as an educational tool for the needs of marginalized people. She lives and works in Kingston, dividing her time between teaching art based classes at Leahurst College and the Agnes Etherington Art Centre. Rappaport maintains an art practice as a member of Dead On Arts Collective and 12 Cat Arts Collective. As an artist, Rappaport hopes to empower people, to be bold and brave when faced with fear or uncertainty. Art is a question, an action, a way \u201cto make sense of things\u201d. Her practice is driven through constant inquiry on quotidian aspects of life and human nature. Subject matter such as landscapes and autonomous human figures are common themes in her work. Painting, drawing and projection are the main tools in her wheelhouse of creation. Rappaport thinks of her viewer as \u201ceveryone\u201d in or out of her art community, aiming to make accessible work that speaks to people from all walks of life. Collaboration is like a dance. Communicating back and forth, avoiding missteps and asking for forgiveness when stepping out of line or on any toes. This project was created, in collaboration between Lee Stewart and Bree Rappaport. This is the first project of this nature for both artists. Lee and Bree have known each other for five years, meeting through Dead On cCollective. Lee and Bree are close to opposites as artist and people, but through collaboration, their styles come together harmoniously. The square is in a constant state of flux, moving from one space to another, one idea to another, and sometimes these ideas overlap. We know that art is subjective to each viewer and hope this work will encourage viewers to bring their own history and narrative to this work. How do they see themselves in Kingston\u2019s historical narrative? We would like this piece to uplift people to dream about the new prospective possibilities in our town. Our making process is in constant flux. As the idea of liminal, thinking about time is not as lineal. Everything is months ahead. Occupying space. Floriana Ehninger Cuervo is a Kingston based illustrator and lettering artist. She runs Colourful Crow Studio where she creates cards, prints, and interactive papercraft.

The INVISTA Centre is a City owned, fully accessible, multi purpose fitness and community centre located in Kingston\u2019s west end at 1350 Gardiners Rd. Public art at the INVISTA Centre is a public art opportunity for Kingston based emerging artists only. This project also aims to bring public art to the west end of Kingston and to animate the facility. In 2018, the City of Kingston issued a public call for submissions to Kingston based artists to create public art for the atrium of the INVISTA Centre. Artists were invited to submit a proposal for a large scale mural, in place for up to 5 years, or pillar wraps, that would be in place for up to one year. The pillars are at ground level and are accessible to all users who pass through the INVISTA Center. A Jury made up of members of the Public Art Working Group, through the Arts Advisory Committee, selected \u201cWaterway\u201d by Danielle Folkerts for the large scale mural and \u201cPortals Series\u201d by Shannon Brown and \u201cThe Toy Camera Series\u201d by Anna Soper for the six pillar wraps. The 2019 call asked that proposals consider that the centre serves a wide variety of community members from all backgrounds and of all ages. This commissioning process was facilitated by the City in keeping with the Public Art Policy as approved. Read the 2019 artist biographies. Read the 2019 artist biographies.

The system then compresses the refrigerant and condenses it from a vapour to a liquid, releasing the heat so that the cooled/liquid refrigerant can be expanded and sent back into the home, where it starts the cycle again. There are two types of central air conditioner systems to choose from: $2,400 to more than $6,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Room air conditioners, also known as, window air conditioners, cool individual rooms rather than your entire home. These air conditioners are less expensive to operate than central air conditioners because they only provide cooling in areas that are needed. They are also a good option for residents in high rise buildings without central air conditioning. $200 to $600 Source: Natural Resources Canada Space and water heating are the biggest users of energy in Canadian homes which accounts for approximately 80per cent of residential energy consumption and 99per cent of GHG emissions in Ontario residences Boilers use gas or oil to provide space heating and hot water to your home. Boilers distribute heat using radiators or in floor radiant heating, eliminating the need for pre existing duct systems. Gas and oil boilers are subject to Canada\u2019s Energy Efficiency Regulations, which sets minimum performance standards for their energy efficiency. All boilers sold in Canada are energy efficient. Check the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) rating, the minimum should be between 82 and 84 per cent. Replacing your oil boiler? Consider switching to a natural gas boiler which tends to produce less waste and fewer harmful emissions. $3,000 to $8,000 Source: Natural Resources Canada If your house, or a room, has moist or wet stains on a wall or ceiling, musty odours, windows or pipes that are covered with condensation, and/or feels stuffy, you may need a dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers regulate the humidity in a room by removing excess moisture from the air, thereby creating a living condition that is inhospitable to dust mites, mould and other allergenic organisms. They run quietly and efficiently in the background without most people even noticing. There are two types of dehumidifiers available, portable and whole house. For significant, year round issues of high humidity, get a whole house dehumidifier that uses your home\u2019s heating and cooling system to reduce the humidity throughout your entire house. If the humidity is periodic or confined to one room, a portable unit is sufficient. Whole house units $1,000 \u2013 $2,000+; portable units $150 \u2013 $300. Source: Natural Resources Canada Heating water accounts for up to 20 per cent of a home\u2019s energy use, making it the second highest energy consumer after space heating. Drain water heat recovery systems capture the heat from water going down a drain, typically the shower, and use it to heat cold water entering your water heater. It\u2019s particularly effective when there are simultaneous water flows i.e. when you\u2019re using hot water in the shower at the same time that water is flowing down the drain. $550 \u2013 $1,700 plus installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada A furnace uses ductwork and vents to distribute warm air throughout your house. High efficiency gas furnaces are quiet, reliable, and effective at maintaining a comfortable home, and they can reduce your energy bill by up to 45 per cent. An ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified forced air furnace, fueled by gas uses 6 per cent less energy, fueled by oil uses 9 per cent less energy, on average than a standard model. Space heating represents more than half of your home\u2019s energy use and offers the most potential for reducing your energy bill. If your furnace was installed before 1990, it\u2019s probably a lower efficiency model, as regulations for furnaces in Canada have been updated since then. If you upgrade to an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified furnace, you will save money and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases you emit. $2,000 \u2013 $8,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Space heating accounts for 60per cent of the energy used in the average Canadian home. For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation.

A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air. Choose an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ductless heating and cooling system to cut your electrical heating bill by up to 60 per cent, and your cooling bill by 30 per cent, depending on your climate. $2,500 to $5,000+ per unit, including installation.

If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures. Ground source heating produce less CO2 than other forms of space heating systems. $20,000 \u2013 $40,000, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Homes built after 1977 are typically more airtight, which helps to prevent heat loss but also prevents air circulation, which is important for your health and comfort. Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems. Source: Natural Resources Canada Heating water accounts for approximately 20per cent of your home\u2019s energy bill. Water heaters with storage tanks are the most common in Canadian homes, but they are not the most energy efficient. Electricity, gas or oil is used to heat water stored in the tank and supply it, as needed, to household fixtures and appliances. Storage tanks typically hold between 113 and 378 litres of water in their tanks, and this water is continuously reheated and kept hot 24 hours a day. $800 to $1,500, plus installation.

Tankless water heaters heat water as it flows, and only when required, using an electric element or gas burner. They provide endless hot water and the heat on demand feature means you only pay to heat water as you use it, instead of paying to keep a tank of water heated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. $1,000 to $2,800 Source: Natural Resources Canada", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/business/planning-and-development/planning-studies/land-review/property-information-form": "", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/recreation/facilities/community/kingston-east": "There are several options to access the facility gym, fitness centre and drop in programming.

This project is now in its public engagement phase. A March 2019 report shows that achieving this goal is possible but will require changes to service levels, programs and policies. These new strategies will be implemented and used to update the City's Integrated Waste Management Plan. Diverting waste from landfill is good for the land, air and water  the whole environment benefits when less waste is sent to landfill! Watch this video about how waste reacts in a landfill. Diverting waste means capturing valuable resources out of the garbage sent to landfill that can be reused, recycled or composted. Capturing these resources and keeping them out of landfill decreases carbon and methane gas emissions which are contributors to climate change and prevents toxins from being released to land/water. While \u2018reduce' is always the first \u2018R' \u2013 and we encourage Kingstonians to reduce their waste \u2013 this public consultation is specifically focused on understanding how to capture the recyclables and organics that continue to be placed into the garbage that's put out at the curb and sent to landfill by the households in our community. When a 2006 set goal of reaching 65 per cent household waste diversion rate was not achieved in 2012, council set this rate as a long term goal to be reached by 2025. An interim goal of 60 per cent was set for 2018. That goal was reached in 2015 with the voluntary participation of Kingstonians in diversion programs. This diversion rate has held steady through 2017 (and, it's expected, through 2018). Find out more about this goal in a March 6, 2019, Waste Diversion Rate and Integrated Waste Management Plan Update Report to the environment infrastructure and transportation policies committee. To achieve the 65 per cent goal changes to service levels, programs and policies will be required and will inform the updates to the Integrated Waste Management Plan.

Think about how you use your backyard composter. You throw in organics which are exposed to oxygen and then later, after decomposing, you return it to your gardens as the compost supplies many nutrients. It's a myth though that organics are good for landfills. All waste in a landfill harms the environment \u2013 soil, waterways and the air are all affected. Once organics like apple cores, orange peels and other food wastes go into the landfill they start to decompose under the earth and are starved of oxygen. As they decompose they create carbon dioxide and methane gases which build up, and eventually release into the atmosphere. These gases are known to cause climate change. Even though the items decompose into soil within the landfill, the new soil made cannot be used. Put them in the green bin and they will be brought to a special processing facility to be turned into compost, the nutrients are saved and can be used in agricultural fields or gardens. The non organic wastes (items containing metal or plastics) can contain harsh metals or petroleums that can leach into surrounding soils and waterways affecting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The waste diversion rate is measured by adding up the total quantity (usually measured by kilograms or tonnes) all of the waste streams/types \u2013 garbage + recycling + organics, etc. \u2013 managed. This total becomes the denominator in the equation to calculate the diversion rate. Next, you add up the quantity that was sent for recycling or composting, basically all of the tonnes of recyclables and organics that was diverted (i.e., not sent) from landfill. This becomes the numerator in the equation. To calculate the rate in percentage terms, the total quantity of waste diverted (numerator) is divided by the total quantity of waste managed (denominator). For example: All waste managed equals 40,000 tonnes, of that 40,000 tonnes, 25,000 was sent for recycling and composting. The diversion rate is 25,000 divided by 40,000 equals a 62.5 per cent diversion rate. Waste diversion means capturing certain items that can be reused, recycled or composted instead of thrown into a landfill. Garbage containing recyclables or organics that is thrown into a landfill, is a lost opportunity. Waste materials that are sorted retain their value and can be recycled into new products, saving valuable resources, energy and money. Diverting materials like metal, organic waste, electronic and hazardous waste also helps to protect our environment from contaminated run off that is known as toxic leachate, and prevents the release of carbon dioxide and methane gases into the air. The City has discussing the importance of waste diversion for several years. Most recently the City reached its goal to divert 60 per cent of residential waste from landfill by 2018. The goal was achieved three years early in 2015. However, the diversion rate has flatlined, but we've got a goal of 65 per cent waste diversion to reach by 2025. The City has implemented a number of diversion programs to send less waste to landfill. And although residents are doing great, we can do better to capture more recyclables, organics and other divertible items from the garbage sent to landfill. New strategies to manage waste better to reach 65 per cent waste diversion by 2025 are needed. In 2015, City Council set a long range goal of reaching 65 per cent waste diversion by 2025. Absolutely! Based on data collected from waste composition audits, the City could achieve a 76 per cent waste diversion rate. A waste composition audit looks at the make up or composition of the items in the garbage, recycling and organic streams. This audit helps the City understand improvements that are necessary. It also tells the City how well residents are doing to divert as much waste as possible. We're not entirely sure. But here's what we know: One thing is for sure, certain items like recyclables and organics are not ending up in recycling boxes or green bins as intended or as desired by the City. The recycling and green bin programs are completely voluntary today, meaning that residents are not required to use the diversion programs. As part of this process, we're hoping to understand the barriers for people to use or participate in the diversion programs. Basically we want to learn what needs to be implemented or changed to get everyone using recycling boxes and green bins on each collection day \u2013 making sure waste ends up in the right place.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/projects-construction/waste-strategies/engagement": "Want to know how engagement opportunities are being used to advance this project?

First rented out to a saloon and the Post Office, this space housed the Council Chamber and Mayor's office for more than 100 years Early challenges in the Limestone City\u2026 Fire and disease posed constant threats for early Kingstonians. A disastrous fire in April, 1840 destroyed 43 buildings. Council responded with a ban on wooden structures in the downtown. Eventually, locally sourced limestone replaced wood as a building material. Meanwhile, periodic outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and typhoid wreaked havoc on the population. Cholera outbreaks in 1832 and 1833 killed close to 10 per cent of the population. In 1847 Irish immigrants fleeing famine in Ireland unwittingly brought typhoid fever to Kingston and more than 1,200 people perished. Council ordered the Board of Health \"to prepare a set of rules and regulations\" to assist the immigrants. Moreover, fear of disease moved Council to order improvements in water, sewer and sanitation services. Money and Magistrates City Hall's  1 tenant Beginning in 1850, the Bank of British North America occupied this space for 74 years. Entered from Ontario St. at the south end of the building, there were offices for the manager and clerks along the west wall and two large public banking rooms. Successful careers were born here \u2013 Irish born Robert Harvey began as a teller in the late 1800s and rose to manager by 1918. A man of many talents, he was organist at St. George's Cathedral for 39 years. Following a merger in 1918 this location became a branch of the Bank of Montreal; it later closed in 1926. Several wall niches, possibly used by customers to fill out deposit slips, are a reminder of City Hall's longest tenant. Great Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914: In January 1920, Kingston's newly elected Mayor Hugh Nickle proposed \"\u2026 that the windows in the City Hall be a memorial type, and that brass tablets be erected between the columns and a record kept of those who enlisted in Kingston.\" Twelve local citizens subscribed $450 for the stained glass windows that depict battles in which Canadians fought during the First World War. As well, brass plaques memorialize Kingstonians who served, and those who died. Lord Byng of Vimy, the Governor General of Canada, officiated at the 1921 dedication of Memorial Hall. In 1946, Governor General, Field Marshall Viscount Alexander dedicated a Book of Remembrance honouring those who fought in the Second World War. Memorial Hall: Kingston's Living Room Whether it was Fairtile's splendid quadrille band performing for a \u2018soiree' in 1847 or the lying in state of Canada's first prime minister in 1891, no other room in Kingston has as rich a history. Transformed in 1879 into a \u2018drawing room', the chamber welcomed Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Louise and her husband Lord Lorne, the Governor General of Canada. Political rallies, temperance lectures and amateur theatricals have all taken place here. In 1921 the room was renamed Memorial Hall to commemorate Kingstonians who died serving in the First World War. Today, Memorial Hall continues to be a community gathering space: citizenship ceremonies; children's music festivals; weddings, and occasionally, heated political debates. Each year 10,000 visitors are introduced to the room's splendid architecture. Ontario Hall has been repurposed many times during the years: Leading Change: Women's Education at City Hall In 1883, after male dominated Queen's University medical school expelled its female students, the Women's Medical College Kingston was founded at Kingston City Hall. Lectures were delivered in present day Ontario Hall, and one floor above a room was set aside for dissections. Graduates later practiced medicine both in Canada and abroad as missionaries. Having outgrown its City Hall space, in 1890 the College moved to Union Street. Faced with stiff competition from women's medical programs in Toronto and Montreal, the college closed in 1893/4. Located at the intersection of the attics of the three wings of City Hall, this area served several uses over the years: \"A dome will go over the centre portion, which is flanked to each side by a wing.\" Kingston Town Council meeting, 6 July 1842 Living below the dome\u2026 For more than 100 years City Hall's live in caretakers had an apartment in this area. John Ballantyne (1903 1928) was one of the longest serving in the post. He helped save items from the flames during the 1908 dome fire. Other caretakers included Arthur and Caroline Singleton, who lived here for 12 years (1929 1941). The last tenants, Arthur and Bessie Davis (1943 to 1963), lived with their son Vincent, an electrician with the Fire Department. Floor plans from early 1900s show three bedrooms, a kitchen, and dining and living rooms. Renovations in 1973 converted the apartment into offices. The fireplace near the modern day elevator is a reminder of this space's former use as a living room. Market Square \"The market \u2026 in the rear of the main building will be built of coursed stone \u2026 have butcher stalls \u2026 and a vegetable market. The market's basement will have cellars under the butchers' stalls and shops for hucksters\" (Kingston Town Council meeting, 6 July 1842) A Place of Gathering and Groceries The square below has been a gathering place for Kingstonians since 1801: Confederation was proclaimed on 1st July 1867; troops departed to various wars; people gathered for rallies and civic celebrations. But throughout its long history the square has been a market. At first it was an open air market where fishmongers, butchers, green grocers and peddlers sold their wares. In 1844 an indoor market was included in the new town hall. After fire destroyed the indoor market 20 years later, most vendors moved back outdoors. Now called Springer Market Square, the City redeveloped this space in 2008 and added a fountain and an outdoor winter skating rink. \"In the main building's cellar will be a station house for police, office and four cells\u2026\" Kingston Town Council meeting, July 6, 1842 Locked Up in the Limestone City When the police department moved here in late 1844, Kingston was in turmoil. The parliament of the Province of Canada had just moved to Montreal and the loss of more than 1,000 well paying jobs left the community in severe recession. On the streets of Kingston, the five man police force faced rampant drinking, fighting, petty crime and homelessness involving men, women and children. \"In the main building's cellar will be a station house for police, office and four cells, the rest of the cellar will house business shops.\" Kingston Town Council meeting, July 6, 1842 Those \"business shops\" included: Although not in the original plans, in the 1840s and 1850s space was set aside for several families in need of accommodation. City Hall: Kingston's first social housing Difficult times call for unusual measures. When the economy of Kingston took a double hit in the 1840s  the provincial capital moved to Montreal in 1844; a typhoid epidemic accompanied Irish immigrants in 1847 \u2013 several destitute families were allowed to live in the basement of City Hall. Residents cooked and heated their rooms with wood stoves and with the increased risk of fire the City's insurance agent threatened to increase premiums in 1848. The families were asked to leave, but with nowhere to go, some stayed. As late as 1855 the City was still trying to remove non business tenants. A compromise allowed some to continue to live here, but with strict control over stoves and pipes.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/explore/culture-history/arts/public-art/168-division-street-mural": "Highpoint Properties worked with the City of Kingston on the creation of an exterior large scale mural on a new residential development at 168 Division St. A mural was identified as a community benefit through Section 37 of the Planning Act that permits the City to authorize increases in permitted height and/or density through the zoning bylaw for new developments in return for community benefits. The mural is funded by Highpoint Developments. The building and the site of the mural is located near the intersection of Princess and Division Street, also known as \u201cthe Hub.\u201d The mural aligns with a City initiative called The Hub Project that brings public art to the area of Princess and Division Street, as a gateway to downtown Kingston and nexus for multiple neighbourhoods. The City supported the artist selection and process in alignment with its Public Art Policy. Through the Art in Public Places Working Group, five mural artists were invited to submit a Statement of Interest for the project. A jury made up of local mural artists, visual artists, curators, community members and the developer shortlisted two artists to submit a proposal. The City facilitated a public engagement opportunity, sharing the two shortlisted proposals for feedback. The input received was then shared with the artists and the jury for their review and consideration as part of the final selection process. The public engagement ran from June 24 \u2013 July 4, 2022, and a recap of the feedback can be viewed on Get Involved Kingston. The jury selected Peru Dyer Jalea for his mural, Kingston: A Moment in the City, as the successful artist for the 168 Division St. Mural. Art type: Permanent, owned by Highpoint Developments Budget: $51,500 Location: 168 Division St., Kingston Peru is an internationally recognized Peruvian Canadian muralist whose 25 years of experience and practice is informed by digital and traditional artforms. His work aims to heal, inspire and uplift communities by transforming neglected and often oppressive spaces into safe, playful, and imaginative worlds. A proponent of the \u2018Graffuturism\u2019 movement, much of Peru\u2019s artistic energy today is dedicated to bridging and advancing the traditions of graffiti and mural art, as points for dialogue, exchange and connection. Ultimately, his higher purpose as an artist is to create works that communicate the need to rise above our differences by understanding the interconnectedness of all living things. Inspired by his Latin American culture, Peru has painted murals and exhibited his work internationally for over two decades. His murals and work have been shown throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia, but he began his career in Canada after moving here from Peru at the age of 15. He has created murals for municipalities, institutions, festivals and non for profit, grass roots organizations, which make up most of his portfolio and which he holds dear to his heart. My work aims to heal, inspire and uplift people\u2019s spirits by transforming neglected and often oppressive spaces into safe, playful, and imaginative worlds. My style is marked by a puzzle like use of simple geometric shapes, clean parallel lines, and a use of coexisting primary colours evocative of the simplicity of childhood. Through reworking simple symmetry and bright graphic elements into complex patterns, my work evokes a feeling of meditative uplifting wonder. I particularly enjoy breaking the monotony of the dull city landscape with as much colour as I can to give the viewers a break from their daily routine and invite them into their own imagination. I hope to catch their attention and take them away from their routines and daily concerns and offer a safe place within themselves where they can get lost in meditation as they discover something new every time they dive into the mural. Coming from a graffiti background, my work is rooted in lettering as a foundation and then polished through a process of intuitive restructuring to custom fit the spaces I am invited to beautify. Legible enough for people to find it in time, the subtly written \u201cKINGSTON\u201d invites the community to continue developing a sense of pride with a new landmark and tourist destination. Ultimately, my purpose is to create works that communicate the need to rise above our differences by understanding the interconnectedness of all living things.

With the effects of climate change already impacting our community and beyond, collective action is essential for moving toward a more sustainable Kingston. There are many organizations in our community that are already working to create a more resilient and low carbon Kingston. I was pleased to bring together many of these groups at the first Climate Leadership Working Group (CLWG) meeting late last month. Our goal \u2013 to identify new opportunities for climate action, at the community level, that will help us move closer to our goal of carbon neutrality by 2040. Many of these organizations participated in the development of the Climate Leadership Plan (CLP) through the extensive community engagement undertaken throughout the process. We also welcomed some new representatives, and while they may not have been involved directly with the CLP, they have worked hard to advance climate action at an individual level and as members of their organizations. Each member of the CLWG is doing great work in our community. I invite you to review the full list of our members and if their work inspires you to act, please follow their social media, subscribe to their newsletters and share their great work with your friends and family. While the CLWG is a new group that will make recommendations on the implementation of the actions within the CLP and help us realize our goals, the Kingston Community Climate Action Fund (KCCAF) has launched for its third year! The KCCAF was established as a way to empower organizations to become part of city wide solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These organizations apply to participate in the fund, and when approved, fundraise to complete individual community climate action projects. This year, the KCCAF is seeking to raise over $110,000 to support three climate action projects.100% of all funds raised will go directly to these Kingston charities and contributions will be matched up to $5,000 thanks to the generosity of the Kingston Community Credit Union. Building climate resiliency isn\u2019t easy. It requires active participation from the entire community. The KCCAF helps organizations realize their sustainability goals by contributing funds for projects that may not be possible otherwise. It also provides an opportunity for the entire community to get involved in climate action by supporting causes that not only reduce overall GHG emissions but also offer additional benefits to the Kingston community. Among those benefits are the creation of much needed accessible daycare spaces, improved access to outdoor spaces for those with developmental disabilities and increased awareness of energy conservation in our community. Donating to the KCCAF makes a difference in more ways than one. And with that in mind, I\u2019m pleased to share this year\u2019s projects and organizations: Frontenac Club Day Care is seeking your support for building retrofits that will create 22 new licensed daycare spaces in Kingston and a new wheelchair accessible preschool and infant room. These building retrofits include the installation of two new heat pump systems in both the coach house and infant house well as spray foam insulation, improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Ongwanada is seeking your support to purchase an electric wheelchair transport bike that can be used to take the residents of Ongwanada on outdoor excursions in Kingston to help maintain their mental and physical health. The electric bike will provide the necessary support residents need while enjoying the outdoors and staying active. These bikes would reduce Ongwanada\u2019s contribution to GHGs by taking residents out for excursions in an electric powered bike instead of a fossil fuel burning van. Sustainable Kingston is seeking your support for the purchase of an electric vehicle that will replace gas powered vehicle use. This electric vehicle will be used by the Residential Energy Auditors when they perform home energy audits across Kingston, directly reducing GHGs and promoting energy conservation. We are thankful for those who have already donated in support of the KCCAF and these deserving organizations. If you are looking for a way to take real, local, and measurable climate action, we encourage you to donate to the KCCAF now through March 31. Donate online today!

So far as the City and Utilities Kingston know, none of the small cell antennas installed in Kingston are capable of providing 5G service. Could existing cell antennas on City or Kingston Hydro property that a telecom carrier has leased space on, be replaced with 5G capable ones by the telecom carrier? Existing antenna infrastructure could be replaced with upgraded equipment under existing lease arrangements. Such changes may have to be reviewed by Utilities Kingston, on behalf of the City or Kingston Hydro, if new equipment were to change the weight load on poles. Utilities Kingston is not aware of any 5G capable small cell antennas operating in Kingston. Can the City or Kingston Hydro cancel existing leases for radio communication infrastructure?

Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A backwater valve, also called a backflow valve, is a device used to prevent outbound water in a home\u2019s drain pipes from re entering, or \u201cbackflowing\u201d\u2014into your home. The valve has a flap that allows water to leave but closes to prevent water and/or sewage from entering. Backwater valves are designed to close the sewer line during periods of extreme rain to prevent water from entering your home. When the valve is closed you should not use any plumbing fixtures (i.e. toilets, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines) because water will not drain and will back up into your home. The Insurance Bureau of Canada recommends residents not install the plug type valves, as they allow sewer backup pressure to build beneath your basement floor, which may cause structural damage to your home. $500 to $2,000 including installation. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. Early detection of water leakage can help you quickly determine the cause and source of the leak and address it before flooding occurs. Flood alarms, also known as, flood detectors, water alarms or water detectors are electronic devices that detect the presence of water and set off an alarm when its sensors are triggered. Flood alarms come in different shapes and sizes and with a wide range of features. New models have WiFi capabilities with smart home integration. $25 to $150 Cool roofs reflect the sun\u2019s rays and reduce heat build up through a light coloured or highly reflective roofing product such as a coating, new membrane or shingle. Most roofs in Canada are dark in colour and absorb heat from the sun\u2019s rays transferring it into the rooms below. Because cool roofs are better at reflecting the sun\u2019s energy, less heat is transferred inside your home. As a result, you may not have to use your air conditioner as much, saving you energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cool roofs also increase the life expectancy of your roof, because they reflect the heat and UV rays that damage and age roof materials. Dark coloured roofs in high density areas also contribute to the urban heat island effect \u2013 significantly warmer temperatures in urban areas compared to rural areas. As a result of climate change, Kingston is expected to see dramatic increases in the number of extremely hot days due to continued global warming. Installing a cool roof is one way to help to offset this. There are cool roof options for all types of roofs, including steep slope (pitched roofs), low slope (flat roofs).. Roofing products are tested for their reflectivity and given a Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value between 0 100. The higher the number, the more reflective it is. If you want to convert an existing roof into a cool roof, you have the following options: Green roofs are living roofs. They support the growth of vegetation and consist of a waterproofing membrane, drainage layer, organic growing medium (soil), and vegetation. Green roofs capture stormwater, improve air quality and create habitats for pollinators, birds and other wildlife. Green roofs also help insulate your home in the summer and help reduce the overall temperature in Kingston. Green roof systems are generally classified as extensive, semi intensive or intensive. Your budget, vision and the structural capacity of your building will determine which type of green roof you select. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A sump pump is a small pump that is installed at the lowest part of your basement or crawlspace that prevents flooding. The sump is the low space that collects liquids, while the sump pump detects water in the sump and moves it away from your home through a network of pipes that is dug into the floor of the basement. Groundwater can easily rise through the cracks in your foundation during long periods of rain. If there is a possibility that flooding can occur in your basement or crawl space, a sump pump will collect all of this water and redirect it away from your home. There are two types of primary sump pumps available: submersible and pedestal pumps. Submersible pumps have the motor placed underwater in your sump basin, while pedestal pumps are positioned with the pump motor out of the water, above your sump basin. It is recommended that Kingston residents consider a submersible sump pump as they are the quietest, most powerful and effective sump pump. They also allow for an airtight lid that will stop debris from falling into the pit and prevent moisture and odorous air from being released into your home. $700 to $5,000, including installation.

Controlled pedestrian crossings are locations where motorists and cyclists are required to yield the right of way to pedestrians. They involve a combination of signage, pavement markings, and in some cases, signals or flashing beacons. Visit Get Involved Kingston to see the engagement for Pedestrian Crossing locations. See a map of existing pedestrian crossings. Pedestrian crossovers, also known as PXOs, are marked crosswalks where vehicles must yield to pedestrians crossing the road. They are identified by specific signs and pavement markings. Pedestrians: Motorists: Cyclists: The Pedestrian crossover (PXO) Type B includes overhead and side mounted signs, pavement markings, and a rapid rectangular flashing beacon (RRFB) and push buttons that can be activated by pedestrians. Examples of this type of PXO in Kingston include the crosswalk on Rideau Street in front of Rideaucrest Home and at King Street in front of Kingston General Hospital. The PXO Type C includes side mounted signs, pavement markings, and a rapid rectangular flashing beacon (RRFB) and push buttons that can be activated by pedestrians. The PXO Type D includes side mounted signs and pavement markings, including a ladder crosswalk and a 'yield to pedestrians' marking for motorists. An intersection pedestrian signal (IPS), also known as a \"half signal\", provides a legal crossing for pedestrians across a major roadway. An IPS consists of traffic signal heads for vehicles on the major street only along with signalized pedestrian fixtures and crosswalks. Vehicles approaching the intersection from the side street are controlled by a stop sign. These signals have been installed at a number of locations in Kingston including on King Street at the Tett Centre, King Street at Beverly Street and on Bath Road in front of Frontenac Secondary School. Pedestrians: Motorists and Cyclists: Pedestrians must push a button to activate the walk indicator, which is followed by the flashing hand display. Vehicles on the major roadway must obey the IPS signal and vehicles on the side street must obey the stop sign. After coming to a complete stop, motorists may turn onto the major roadway when it is clear and safe to do so. Vehicles must yield the right of way to pedestrians crossing the main or side streets and to vehicles travelling along the major street. A mid block pedestrian signal (MPS) consists of traffic signal heads for vehicles on the major street along with signalized pedestrian fixtures and crosswalks. Since MPS are installed between intersections, there is no side street traffic. As with an IPS, pedestrians must push a button to activate the walk indication and vehicles on the roadway are subject to the same regulations as at any full traffic signal. Sidewalks are paved paths (concrete or asphalt), generally installed adjacent to roadways, that allow pedestrians to walk in a dedicated area. Off road trails are separated spaces typically through a natural area or corridor that accommodates pedestrians and cyclists. The surface type can range from natural surface to asphalt depending on the location. Both portions of the Waterfront Trail and the K&P Trail are examples of off road trails. In boulevard trails are a separated space found within the boulevard of the roadway \u2013 in place of a sidewalk, which accommodate both pedestrians and cyclists in a shared space. In boulevard trails can be either uni or bi directional. The Bath Road Bikeway is an example of an in boulevard trail in Kingston. Pedestrian priority crossings give priority to the crossing needs of people on foot (and those using mobility devices). They are often called scramble crossings because of the way they allow pedestrians to scramble across the intersection in any direction on the all directions walk signal. The scramble signal at Union and University will operate 24/7 and will stop vehicular traffic in all directions during the scramble phase. In order to further improve pedestrian safety, vehicles will not be permitted to make a right turn on a red light at any time at this intersection. Pedestrians When the walk signal is displayed in all directions, pedestrians can cross to any corner \u2013 even diagonally. This is indicated by the diagonal crosswalk markings and all directions walk signals at the corners of Union Street and University Avenue. Pedestrians may still cross in the direction of traffic when vehicles have a green light and motorists making a left turn or right turn must still yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk as usual. Cyclists Cyclists must dismount and walk their bicycles if they want to cross on the pedestrian priority/scramble signal. Cyclists who do not dismount their bicycles are legally considered vehicles and must obey vehicular traffic signals, including the right turn on red ban. Motorists Motorists are not permitted to proceed in any direction during the scramble crossing \u2013 when the all direction walk signal and all direction red traffic signals are displayed. Motorists should expect increased delays at the intersection since the red lights will be longer in order to accommodate the pedestrian priority/scramble crossing. When the green light is displayed, motorists can proceed as usual and travel straight through the intersection or turn left or right when safe to do so.

The use of AMPs was introduced in light of the COVID 19 pandemic and the risk that the kinds of gatherings that result in complaints could pose to the community. Authorized under section 434.1 of the Municipal Act, the AMP process means that fines under the Nuisance Party and Noise Bylaws can now be issued and resolved directly through the City. The City has worked closely with Kingston Police and KFL&A Public Health to develop this approach. On Jul. 13, 2021, Council approved the expanded use of AMPs to a variety of City Bylaws. The purpose of the expansion is to provide an expedited resolution for bylaw violations and reduce the number of minor violations processed through the Provincial Offences Court system. Normally, fines issued under City Bylaws are permitted by Provincial Offences Act and are processed by the Provincial Offences Court system. Those who receive a ticket under the Provincial Offences Act may request a trial in the Provincial Offences Court. Operations at the provincial level have been suspended with no set date to resume due to the pandemic and a significant backlog is expected. AMPs have been found to be an effective alternative to the court system for processing minor by law violations and in cases where delayed adjudication may encourage continued non compliance. The AMP process is similar to the current process for municipal parking infractions. Under the AMP process: Kingston Police and Municipal Enforcement Officers will still be able to issue fines through the standard process, meaning that a fine under a City bylaw may still result in a Part One Court Summons. Bylaw Enforcement Officers also enforce the Water Bylaw.

The Divisional Court just released their final decision on an appeal request from the Frontenac Heritage Foundation \u2013 the Divisional Court decision refuses the request and upholds the November 2021 decision from the Ontario Land Tribunal (the OLT or the Tribunal) approving the two towers. The decision allows a new 19 storey building on Block 3 (51 57 Queen Street) and a 23 storey building on Block 5 (18 Queen Street and 282 Ontario Street). Collectively, the two towers will introduce approximately 400 new residential units, new commercial/museum space and new office space to a key area in our downtown that is targeted by our Official Plan for growth and intensification. I previously wrote about these applications in a series of blog posts covering the original Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (now the OLT) decision (Understanding the August 9 North Block LPAT ruling on August 18, 2019), the decision ordering a new hearing (Outcome of the Section 35 Review for the North Block: LPAT orders a new hearing on January 10, 2020) and the final decision from the OLT (To Get Better Planning Decisions, We Need to Get the Facts Right on November 9, 2021). The Divisional Court decision summarizes the lengthy application background and confirms that the Tribunal\u2019s decision \u201cframed its consideration of the proposed redevelopment in terms of the need to balance heritage and intensification\u201d. It acknowledges that the City \u201chas designated certain areas in the downtown core as Heritage Conservation Districts or Heritage Character Areas. The City has targeted other areas in the same downtown core for growth and intensification, to respond to housing and employment needs, and to contribute to a vital and robust community.\u201d It also reiterates an important element of the evidence that was presented at the OLT, stating \u201cAccording to unchallenged expert evidence submitted to the Tribunal, the economic conditions in Kingston's downtown are fragile and Homestead's proposed development is an important component in the City's plans for its economic recovery.\u201d These two towers will help to ensure the economic heart of our City, our downtown, will remain economically viable by adding more housing, commercial, cultural and office spaces. Why is the economic recovery of the downtown vital to the City overall and why should every resident of Kingston care about this? This YouTube video is a must watch \u2013 it explains this idea better than I ever could in a blog post. In June of 2021, we provided Council with the Lifecycle Fiscal Impacts of Development report, which looked that this exact idea in Kingston \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 the statements in the YouTube video are spot on for Kingston too. This decision supports the professional opinions provided by City staff, both to Council and to the Ontario Land Tribunal, and confirms that our downtown can evolve with large scale intensification projects in the right locations without impacting the important cultural heritage resources we value as a City. The Divisional Court decision, when speaking to the previous Capitol Theatre redevelopment decision (IN8 and Burfoot), clarifies that the future vision for the North Block is different than that specific area of the Princess Street by stating: \u201cLastly, Frontenac contends that the Tribunal should have rejected the proposed development because, in IN8 and Burfoot, it held that proposals to build high rise towers in downtown Kingston were incompatible with the Official Plan's objective of preserving Kingston's unique heritage character. There is no general prohibition, either in the Official Plan or in the Tribunal's previous decisions, on the construction of high rises in downtown Kingston.\u201d These buildings represent a positive evolution for planning in Kingston. The two towers will redevelop two contaminated properties and revitalize this area by bringing a significant number of new housing units close to diverse commercial, employment and recreation options. They will help to achieve our climate action and sustainability goals by bringing more population to an area that does not rely on cars to get to places we work, live and play. They will introduce new museum space, commercial opportunities and office spaces that will help to further the vitality and the long term economy of our downtown and City overall. The buildings are well designed and will make this stretch of Queen Street more comfortable for pedestrians with human scaled architecture along the street. They will bring exciting new commercial and pedestrian activity to an area that is currently covered by uninviting parking lots. Perhaps most importantly, the approval of these towers confirms that the vision and intentions of the City\u2019s Official Plan is for heritage and intensification to work harmoniously. Some people may never agree with the Official Plan on this point, but in downtown Kingston, the two rely on each other and are both vital for the long term success of our community.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/heritage-conservation": "The City of Kingston is one of the earliest sites of European settlement in Ontario and has a longer history as a meeting place of Indigenous peoples.

The playful installation invites reflection on the relationship between people, nature, and the urban environment. \u201cThe Wilds of Kingston\u201d also creates an opportunity to highlight the counterculture history and landmark status of Princess Towers, formerly known as Elrond College, built in the 1960s as an experimental student run housing cooperative. \u201cThe Wilds of Kingston\u201d creates a new landmark in the area and asks people to think differently about what they see every day.

His public artworks are exhibited across Canada in Ottawa, Calgary, Waterloo, Hamilton, Thunder Bay and Edmonton.

The commissioning of the Princess Street Sidewalk Project involved a two stage procurement process including a Request for Supplier Qualifications (RFSQ) and a Request for Proposal (RFP). The RFSQ was released in March 2020 and closed in May 2020 and three shortlisted artists were selected. Due to COVID 19, the project faced delays in spring/summer 2020. The RFP was released to the shortlisted artists in October 2020. An online public engagement session was then held for three weeks in January 2021 where members of the community were invited to review the proposals of the shortlisted artists and provide feedback. The RFP closed in March 2021. A jury comprised of artists, arts professionals, and representatives from the local businesses in the area where the public artwork was going to be installed, as well as student representation from Queen\u2019s University reviewed all submissions to the RFSQ and RFP. The Hub Project is a multi phase initiative designed to connect neighbourhoods through artful interventions designed to make the intersection of Princess and Division streets, also known as \u201cThe Hub\u201d, more welcoming and friendly for everyone.

The Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act applies to all local government organizations, including: There are separate Acts that apply specifically to provincial ministries, agencies and federal government institutions. Effective January 1, 1991, MFIPPA requires municipal institutions to protect the privacy of an individual's personal information existing in government records and provides a right of access to information held by the municipal institution. The Act creates a privacy protection scheme the government must follow to protect an individual's right to privacy. The scheme includes rules regarding the collection, use, disclosure and disposal of personal information in the custody and control of a municipal institution. In keeping with the spirit of the legislation, the City of Kingston is committed to providing individuals with the right of access to information in its custody and control including most operational records as well as records containing their own personal information, where applicable. This process is called routine disclosure and allows certain records to be disclosed, without having to make a formal request under the Act. Only under limited circumstances does the City require an individual to make a formal MFIPPA request. The MFIPPA legislation states that an institution must provide the requester with the information and/or a decision regarding their request within 30 calendar days from the date a complete request is received. On occasion, an institution may ask for an extension, if the request is for an extensive number of records and/or if an outside third party needs to be contacted. Each municipal organization is required to appoint a head who is responsible for overseeing the administration of the legislation within the institution and for decisions made under the legislation. At the City of Kingston, City Council, by bylaw, designated the Mayor as the head, who in turn delegated the powers and duties of the head to the Manager of the Council Support Division (City Clerk).

Each year, the City issues a Call for applications. The Kingston Environmental Advisory Forum (KEAF) works with City staff to evaluate applications against the eligibility criteria. Members of the committee will make a recommendation to City Council on which projects should move forward for funding. Once approved by Council, summary overviews of the projects are posted online. Residents are invited to support the project of their choice by donating through Canada Helps, at their local KCCU branch or through TD Bank. Want to donate to the Kingston Community Climate Action Fund? Find out more about donating. If a donor does not designate funds for a specific project, their donation will be distributed equally amongst all eligible projects. It may also be used to supplement a grant in situations where one project did not raise sufficient funds. Fundraising to support the KCCAF projects for 2023 runs from December 2022 through March 2023. Funds are distributed in the spring. Applicants are to be registered charities or non profit organizations (including Indigenous groups, churches/faith groups or registered co operatives). Non profits must partner with a registered charity to be eligible. Partnerships with the City could be considered to meet this requirement. Applications will be accepted from Aug. 15 to Sept. 16, 2022. Interested groups should visit this project page on Aug. 15 to complete their online application form. Project proposals will be evaluated based on these elements: Examples of measurable GHG reductions include reduction of fossil fuel use (gasoline, diesel, natural gas, fuel oil, propane) as well as peak electricity demand or a reduction in methane release from organic waste. Carbon sequestration projects such as tree planting or land preservation are ineligible for the KCCAF as there are already numerous similar funding programs in the area. For fundraising, the Fund may prioritize projects that have sustained impacts (i.e. annual emission reductions vs. one time impacts) and/or are scalable. Where projects are similar in terms of GHG input, additional co benefits will be considered (e.g. affordable housing, addressing homelessness, food security, public health). The project budget should only include costs that are directly linked to, and are essential for, undertaking the proposed initiative. Examples: If funding is awarded, all eligible expenditures must be supported by receipts/invoices for submission of final reports for audit purposes. The following are examples of project expenses that are not eligible under the KCCAF grant program: Each year in the fall, a Call for Funding Proposals (CFP) will be issued by the City to attract grant applications for the Fund. The Kingston Environmental Advisory Forum (KEAF) will work with City staff to evaluate the applications against the eligibility criteria. A recommendation will then be presented to City Council. City staff will prepare a summary of the projects to be posted online and allow donors to select which projects they would like to support. If a donor does not designate funds, they will be distributed equally amongst all eligible projects, or could be used to supplement a grant where one project did not raise sufficient funds from the donor selection process. Applicants may require other viable sources of funding to complete the proposed initiative where donations collected do not fully cover all associated costs (see ineligible costs). Donations raised will be disbursed to the eligible projects after the completion of the fundraising campaign in early spring each year. Project proponents will enter into a funding agreement with the City summarizing their roles and responsibilities for project implementation. Funding recipients must monitor the impacts of the project and publicly report results. Summaries of the projects will be posted publicly once they are completed. In situations where funds received are not sufficient to complete a project as proposed and accepted, donations may be reallocated to another eligible project. If an applicant elects not to proceed with a project, funds will be redirected to one of the other eligible projects.

The City of Kingston, in partnership with Tourism Kingston, has recently unveiled a unique and public installation designed by local architecture firm, RAW Design Inc. (RAW). Titled Water Snake, this is a playful, interactive installation designed to delight and engage residents and visitors along Kingston\u2019s waterfront. Water Snake is nestled along the pathway between the Delta Hotel and Battery Park and is an experiment in animating an underdeveloped space in a semi permanent way through a combination of design and technology, involving innovative and sustainable 3D printing done by local company, Nidus3D. The installation features three distinct sculptural segments that offer seating and that also encourage play and interaction. It is meant to help create a sense of place and to propose new ways of thinking about public spaces and how we use them. The installation is animated by a ground mural artwork created by local artist, Jenny Moring. This project is supported by funding from the Canada Community Revitalization Fund. Participants are encouraged to document their artwork and share on social media platforms using the hashtag  YGKStreetArtWall.

Paved Paradise is a temporary public art project that features the work of Kingston based artists on seven pedestrian level billboards at the corner of Ontario and Brock Streets, adjacent to City Hall in downtown Kingston. The project was created in 2018 as a response to a Council directive to \u2018beautify\u2019 a city parking lot at Brock and Ontario streets. Paved Paradise is an important temporary public art platform that provides local emerging artists with a medium scale opportunity to exhibit a body of work that responds to a project goal or theme. Through this exhibition platform, the selected artists who work primarily in 2 dimensional mediums (drawing, illustration, photography, graphic arts) have an opportunity to translate their work to a larger scale public facing exhibition. This is the first artistic collaboration between Lee Stewart and Bree Rappaport. Both are Kingston based artists. Lee Stewart was born and raised in Kashechewan, a small remote reserve on James Bay in northern Ontario. He spent years in the Rideau Lakes region, and studied film and art history at Carleton University in Ottawa. He then lived in Vancouver before returning to establish himself in Kingston. Stewart\u2019s cultural influences are as vast as his lived experience, without hierarchy or elevated status. As a self taught artist, Stewart\u2019s experimentation, innate curiosity, and openness continue to shape his evolving style. Bree Rappaport holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Ontario College of Art and Design University. While in school, she pursued projects around social and environmental justice, community economic development, and art as an educational tool for the needs of marginalized people. She lives and works in Kingston, dividing her time between teaching art based classes at Leahurst College and the Agnes Etherington Art Centre. Rappaport maintains an art practice as a member of Dead On Arts Collective and 12 Cat Arts Collective. As an artist, Rappaport hopes to empower people, to be bold and brave when faced with fear or uncertainty. Art is a question, an action, a way \u201cto make sense of things\u201d. Her practice is driven through constant inquiry on quotidian aspects of life and human nature. Subject matter such as landscapes and autonomous human figures are common themes in her work. Painting, drawing and projection are the main tools in her wheelhouse of creation. Rappaport thinks of her viewer as \u201ceveryone\u201d in or out of her art community, aiming to make accessible work that speaks to people from all walks of life. Collaboration is like a dance. Communicating back and forth, avoiding missteps and asking for forgiveness when stepping out of line or on any toes. This project was created, in collaboration between Lee Stewart and Bree Rappaport. This is the first project of this nature for both artists. Lee and Bree have known each other for five years, meeting through Dead On cCollective. Lee and Bree are close to opposites as artist and people, but through collaboration, their styles come together harmoniously. The square is in a constant state of flux, moving from one space to another, one idea to another, and sometimes these ideas overlap. We know that art is subjective to each viewer and hope this work will encourage viewers to bring their own history and narrative to this work. How do they see themselves in Kingston\u2019s historical narrative? We would like this piece to uplift people to dream about the new prospective possibilities in our town. Our making process is in constant flux. As the idea of liminal, thinking about time is not as lineal. Everything is months ahead. Occupying space. Floriana Ehninger Cuervo is a Kingston based illustrator and lettering artist. She runs Colourful Crow Studio where she creates cards, prints, and interactive papercraft. Chantal Rousseau has been a practicing artist for more than 20 years.

His work combines a background in architecture and urban design with an emergent language of sculpture, installation, collage, photography, and video. Adam Biehler is a Kingston based photographer/videographer whose personal work focuses on the relationship between humans and their environments.

The INVISTA Centre is a City owned, fully accessible, multi purpose fitness and community centre located in Kingston\u2019s west end at 1350 Gardiners Rd. Public art at the INVISTA Centre is a public art opportunity for Kingston based emerging artists only. This project also aims to bring public art to the west end of Kingston and to animate the facility. In 2018, the City of Kingston issued a public call for submissions to Kingston based artists to create public art for the atrium of the INVISTA Centre. Artists were invited to submit a proposal for a large scale mural, in place for up to 5 years, or pillar wraps, that would be in place for up to one year. The pillars are at ground level and are accessible to all users who pass through the INVISTA Center. A Jury made up of members of the Public Art Working Group, through the Arts Advisory Committee, selected \u201cWaterway\u201d by Danielle Folkerts for the large scale mural and \u201cPortals Series\u201d by Shannon Brown and \u201cThe Toy Camera Series\u201d by Anna Soper for the six pillar wraps.

Interested in establishing or expanding your business in Kingston? We will provide the necessary information you need to make an informed choice. The City has a designated industrial lands team comprised of planners, engineers, economic experts and other professionals available to help prospective purchasers find the property that best meets their needs and navigate the following steps. The land purchase process typically begins with informal meetings between prospective developers/purchasers and staff from the Kingston Economic Development Corporation and the City's Real Estate & Environmental Initiatives Department. These early sessions are an opportunity for a purchaser to present a proposed project to local officials and discuss possible land requirements. Tours of available City owned land in the City's four business/industrial parks are arranged and can lead to more detailed discussions. Kingston Economic Development and City officials will help the developer/purchaser find a suitable property, explore government funding opportunities, and arrange discussions with external agencies, as required. Representatives from other City departments and agencies such as Engineering and Planning may get involved at this stage. Once the developer/purchaser has decided on a site, City officials from Real Estate & Environmental Initiatives and Legal Services prepare an Offer to Purchase tailored to the particular parcel of land and proposed use. The typical offer is approximately 20 pages, including appendices. The Offer may include special conditions or requirements to be fulfilled by the purchaser or the City (e.g. required studies to be completed, legal survey, design considerations, etc.). The completed Offer is returned by the Purchaser to Kingston Economic Development along with the Additional Information Form, Development Charges Exemption Application Form, if applicable, and a Deposit representing 10% of the purchase price. The Offer is presented to the City's Chief Administrative Officer by Staff from Legal Services, Kingston Economic Development and Real Estate & Environmental Initiatives, and a negotiation period follows that may take up to 10 or more working days. If necessary, City officials will meet with the Purchaser to finalize the terms of the Agreement before it is formally accepted. Should the City accept the Offer, there will be a binding Agreement of Purchase and Sale. Both parties sign three original copies of the Agreement; two copies remain with the City and one with the developer/purchaser. The City provides the Purchaser with information and reports pertaining to the lands as stipulated in the Agreement. The Purchaser has a specified time frame to conduct any further investigations or assessments of the Lands as per the terms of the Agreement. If satisfied, the Purchaser will waive the conditions and continue with the Planning process to build on the Lands. The closing of the land sale is conditional upon final Site Plan Control approval. The deal will close within three weeks of Site Plan Control approval but the time frame for closing the land sale is flexible and can be reduced if necessary. The balance of the purchase price is due upon closing.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/resident/covid-19": "Check Kingston Economic Development\u2019s COVID 19 Resources for Small Business Page for a comprehensive list of resources to help your business.

This work has culminated in the completion of the City's first Municipal Energy Study (MES). The Municipal Energy Study is the City's first foray into looking at how we use and generate energy from a community perspective. It examines current and future energy use scenarios from the perspective of greenhouse gas emissions and local economic impacts. It examines emerging trends in energy and identifies the following strategic energy objectives: Input from a diverse group of energy stakeholders and the public was used to consider future energy scenarios and identify options for action areas that could address each of the energy objectives. Perhaps the most important findings of the MES have been the identification or reinforcement of opportunities for carbon reduction, local economic development, and energy affordability posed by the potential for bio gas production, electrification of transportation, energy efficiency retrofitting of buildings and the potential feasibility of district energy systems in areas of the City with high energy densities. The MES has also identified emerging trends in energy storage technologies that should be monitored by the City and Utilities Kingston to identify opportunities they provide to adapt energy distribution systems to new loads and potentially reduce infrastructure spending. The MES underscores the importance of integrating transportation planning into land use and a compact urban form  especially as it relates to the energy used in transportation fuels and the viability of active transportation modes. Energy systems at the community and regional levels are complex and contain many interdependencies. Energy technology and policy is also changing rapidly in Ontario. Kingston has energy advantages that include its ownership of Utilities Kingston, the City's role and function of Kingston in our region of Ontario, the high potential for solar and wind energy generation, and access to world class research and technology. The Municipal Energy Study will be useful for those looking to understand and innovate in the local energy field and also as a contributor of data and background to future energy and emissions planning work. The MES also supports implementation of the Kingston Climate Action Plan (KCAP). 216 Ontario Street, Kingston, ON KYL 2Z3", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/roads-and-traffic/road-maintenance": "Keeping roads in good condition for as long as possible \u2013 that's the goal of the City of Kingston's road network maintenance activities. The City is always looking for opportunities to implement new technologies and construction techniques to help us keep Kingston roads in good shape. Here are a few of the ways we are working to improve Kingston roadways: Where possible, a method called microsurfacing is used to extend the life of the asphalt. (A sound pavement structure needs to be in place for microsurfacing to be viable.) Microsurfacing is a cost effective way to preserve pavement used by City contractors. It involves applying: Each treatment is applied in a thin layer designed to seal the pavement and prevent water from getting down into the road base to reduce deterioration, extend the life of the road and create a surface that offers a coarser texture for better skid resistance and a safe wearing surface good for up to eight years. Microsurfacing costs three to five times less than traditional applications. In addition to cost savings, it is more environmentally friendly, uses fewer materials and can be completed much more quickly \u2013 reducing the impact of construction on traffic. The City is testing a new asphalt compaction technology on the Front Road Bridge called TRAK. The asphalt compaction technology was developed by Carleton University Professor Abd El Halim. When you think about compacting asphalt, you might picture a steamroller. TRAK is a new compaction technology that replaces the standard three roller compaction method with a single, static compaction machine. This single machine can make the asphalt up to three times more impermeable than the standard compaction process. Greater impermeability leads to a longer service life for the road \u2013 and increases skid resistance on the road when it's wet. The north side of Front Road Bridge has been paved using a standard compaction method and the south side using TRAK. The bridge is being monitored by the City's engineering department to compare the TRAK system with standard paving methods. FiberMat can slow the appearance of surface cracking by five to seven years. FibreMat involves placing chopped fibreglass strands between layers of asphalt emulsion to slow the appearance of cracks in roads and extend the life of road surfaces. FiberMat is applied to a road surface in layers using special paving equipment. First, a layer consisting of asphalt, water and construction aggregate \u2013 material like sand, gravel and crushed stone\u2013 is sprayed on the existing road surface. Chopped fibreglass strands are then sprayed onto the asphalt mix, followed by a second layer of asphalt mix to seal the surface and ensure the fibreglass strands are protected. Gravel is then rolled into the surface for added strength. A final surface layer of asphalt will be added over FiberMat layers later to provide a smooth and safe driving surface for vehicles. FiberMat acts as a waterproof layer to help prevent water from getting into the road base and slows the appearance of cracks in the surface of the road. It also slows the appearance of cracks by better absorbing the strain of vehicle loads than traditional pavement. Benefits to the FiberMat process include its fast application, which allows road surfaces to re open to traffic more quickly. By extending the life of existing road surfaces, FiberMat also uses fewer materials and less energy than traditional paving methods and is also more cost effective over its entire lifecycle when compared to the costs of traditional paving techniques.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/recreation/programs/skating/": "The City offers lots of opportunities for skaters of all ages to take part in skating activities throughout the year.

Traffic calming measures are designed to slow down motorists and bring greater awareness to the safety issues that speeding creates in residential neighbourhoods. Each year, City Councillors can select a local road for traffic calming in each district. These installations involve the use of Type I (minor adjustment) traffic calming measures to slow vehicles and improve safety which can be installed more readily and adjusted if needed. This process enables the implementation of up to 12 traffic calming installations each year in neighbourhoods across Kingston. When a neighbourhood transportation issue is received, the City conducts an initial review that considers available traffic data, solutions previously implemented, existing policy, and planned capital work. Based on this review, the primary issue is defined and documented, and may be monitored or scheduled for further assessment. If the primary issue is related to speeding or traffic volume, traffic calming approaches may be considered in the following ways: The City has expanded its traffic calming toolkit to provide a wider range of tools. These tools include: Type I (minor adjustment) measures, Type II (engineered based) measures, and Community based initiatives Type I measures are often temporary or seasonal and can be more quickly and easily implemented compared to more permanent measures. These tools are an important step in reducing vehicular speeds and increasing safety for all road users. Type I measures are used on streets put forward by City Councillors as part of the district selected street process. These measures are also considered for use as part of neighbourhood level transportation programs, such as the City\u2019s Safe Routes to School Program. Type II measures are physical changes that are more permanent and involve more resources and longer timelines to plan, design and construct. Type II measures are considered as part of longer term neighbourhood and capital project planning. These plans are informed by the ongoing review of neighbourhood transportation concerns. Community based initiatives involve tools and programs that residents can implement with support from the City. This approach reflects a desire by some residents, community groups, and other stakeholders to address concerns in an area where City led interventions are not yet planned or committed. \u201cSlow Down\u201d lawns are available for residents to encourage motorists to slow down in their neighbourhood. Other community based initiatives are currently under development and will become available over the year. You can learn more about the proposed initiatives in the recent traffic calming report to the Environment, Infrastructure, and Transportation Policies Committee. Traffic calming involves the use of measures that aim to alter driver behaviour and improve safety for all road users. The traffic calming measures considered within the traffic calming policy and guidelines are primarily applicable along Local roads. Local roads are those intended to permit local traffic to access private property and move traffic to and from the minor collector street system in residential and neighbourhood areas. Speed management along Arterial and Collector roads, requires a more comprehensive approach. Arterial roads, like Gardiners or Bath roads, are designed and built for higher volumes of vehicles and higher travel speeds. Managing speed along Arterial roadways requires consistent enforcement and is best addressed through longer term capital planning and policies, such as through the City\u2019s Active Transportation Master Plan. Stop signs are intended for intersection control and are not a recommended tool to address speeding concerns. Placing stop signs at locations that do not meet the recommended criteria can lead to lower compliance and other issues with driver behaviour that can create a false sense of safety for pedestrians. Reducing speed limits on its own tends to have minimal impact on driver behaviour. Many motorists continue to drive at speeds they feel are reasonable and comfortable unless continual enforcement is present. The visual and physical cues that a driver uses to determine the appropriate speed should be consistent with the posted speed limit. You can report speeding or other traffic concerns to Kingston Police by submitting a traffic complaint through their non emergency reporting tool. City staff are monitoring the implementation of Automated Speed Enforcement (ASE) that began in a few Ontario municipalities last year. A report was recently brought forward to Council that provides more information about the Automated Speed Enforcement program.

Councilors have selected each location based on feedback received from residents of their districts. These installations involve Type I (minor adjustment) traffic calming measures, such as flexible bollards, speed display devices, and painted road markings that encourage motorists to slow down and drive with caution. The design and selection of traffic calming measures consider the specific needs and challenges identified along with the local context and existing travel patterns. You can learn more about the City\u2019s Traffic Calming Design Guidelines here. Some Type I measures are temporary (e.g. flexible bollards) and must be removed and stored seasonally to accommodate winter road maintenance activities such as snowplowing. Temporary measures from previous years of the Traffic Calming program are re installed each spring alongside new projects. Many traffic calming implementations include flexible traffic calming bollards that are physically attached to the roadway. These bollards are used by many municipalities to improve road safety and are designed to introduce constriction points that encourage drivers to slow down. It\u2019s recommended not to park immediately adjacent to the bollards. However, in cases where only one vehicle can pass through due to closely parked vehicles, motorists should yield and proceed around the bollard with caution. While they are meant to be avoided, they may be driven over without causing damage to vehicles. Traffic calming bollards are removed to accommodate snow plowing and maintenance activities during the winter and are re installed in the spring.

Nearly a third of all food produced in Canada is wasted and more than 60 per cent of that waste is avoidable. By working to reduce this avoidable waste, you can help limit the impact on climate change. Food contributes to climate change by emitting greenhouse gasses (GHGs) such as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). GHGs are also released throughout the supply chain via harvesting and processing methods as well as transportation. Every time food is wasted, valuable resources such as energy, water and soil nutrients are also lost. By preventing food waste, these resources can be used more sustainably. By planning, buying what you need and storing food properly we can avoid food waste in our landfill. Only dispose of food when it starts to spoil, ideally in compost. The food recovery hierarchy illustrates this order of preference. Change for climate by reducing your waste and by diverting it properly. Garbage sent to landfill contributes to climate changing greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding the terminology of food waste is important in becoming more aware. In Canada, more than 60 per cent of the food wasted could have been consumed at some point. The most commonly wasted food items in Canada are as follows: produce (accounts for nearly half of the waste), followed by leftovers, and bread/baked goods. Every year, the average Canadian household discards over $1,100 worth of food. This represents more than $17 billion worth of food wasted in Canada yearly! In developed countries like Canada, food wastage is almost 10 times more likely to happen after the production and harvesting stages than in developing countries. This is largely due to poor crop planning, inadequate food literacy skills, as well as higher quality standards within the supply chain. The average North American creates over 40 per cent more GHGs from food waste than the global average per person. Learning to respect food by viewing it as the valuable resource it is can help lead to a decrease in food waste and ultimately GHG emissions. Developing food skills brings greater knowledge and appreciation for food. Being involved in the growing, harvesting, preparation and cooking of food strengthens our commitment to it and avoidance to waste the fruit of our labour. Food brings people together and can strengthen social connections in our community. Those that care about food waste are coming together to form partnerships to advocate and share ways to reduce the waste of this valuable resource. Almost half of the food wasted in Canada occurs at the consumer level. Some of this waste is largely unavoidable as it is caused by items not meant to be eaten such as shells, bones, coffee grounds and some vegetable peelings. This is called inedible food waste. Edible food waste is the food that could have been eaten, but was thrown in the compost or the trash. Such waste can be avoided by being conscious of how much you buy, storing food appropriately to keep it fresh and using it up before it goes bad. Best before and expiry dates are often confused with one another but they are not the same. Best before dates refer to the time at which the original food quality (taste, colour and nutrients) is expected to start decreasing. They do not determine food safety. For instance, a loaf of bread will likely be perfectly safe to eat a few days past its best before date, but it may be slightly drier and less flavourful than if it were fresh. Expiry dates are based on food safety guidelines; food items should not be consumed past their expiry date. For example, infant formulas should be discarded past their expiry dates as they may not be safe for consumption beyond that time. Compost the food that has gone bad (spoiled, rotten, mouldy\u2026 as a rule of thumb; if it smells, looks or taste off, toss it) in a green bin or backyard composter. See the Ontario Ministry of Health and Ministry of Long Term Care information on correct food handling. An eating pattern that is higher in plant based foods and lower in animal based foods can decrease the negative impact of food on the environment. In general, plant based foods use fewer resources such as land and water.

The City Encampment Protocol/Procedure is intended to guide staff and partners in providing outreach services to homeless individuals camping outside in public spaces by providing individuals with access to alternative solutions prior to the enforcement of City bylaws, which may lead to the displacement of individuals and the removal of their belongings. The intent is for the City and its partners to assist people camping in public spaces to access safer and healthier alternatives to living outside, including housing, support services and shelter. The protocol also provides a balance between the provision of supports to vulnerable populations camping in public spaces with the City\u2019s desire to maintain intended access and use of public spaces. The objective of this protocol is to establish a clear process for City departments and partners that focuses on a proactive and supportive approach to help vulnerable individuals camping in public spaces relocate to alternative service options prior to any enforcement activities related to public spaces (e.g., such as the removal of unauthorized structures, personal goods and debris). It is always the objective of City staff and its\u2019 partners\u2019 to assist individuals in voluntarily vacating public spaces and securing improved alternatives to sleeping outside, making enforcement unnecessary. In order to be successful and truly support individuals in need, assessments must be performed on a case by case basis, as the needs of individuals camping in public spaces will vary greatly.

I joined the planning profession in 2002, while working on my master's degree in planning at the University of Guelph. Through undergraduate studies in environment and resource studies at the University of Waterloo, I developed a passion to understand all that contributes to making a strong community.

The promenade will connect to the waterfront pathway at Battery Park. Seating, lighting, viewing and swimming opportunities are planned. The 2016 Waterfront Plan included a high level concept for the promenade and was approved by Council. This project was given a ranking of 5 of the 137 projects in the plan. Consultation and detailed planning for the project began in 2021 and in April 2022, Council approved a project scope change to extend the promenade to the lighthouse. The proposed budget was increased to $9M and is included in the City\u2019s 2023 capital budget for consideration. Subject to budget approval, construction would begin in 2023. Community consultation occurred in 2021 and 2022. The project was introduced with a presentation of the proposed promenade extending to the bend of the breakwall. In response to strong community interest, a variety of optional design elements outside the approved budget were also included for feedback through the consultation process. Feedback from the public engagement sessions and online surveys indicated a preference for a longer and wider walkway than the original base design, improving the user experience and increasing the capacity of the promenade. Lengthening the walkway in the future would otherwise be challenging. There was also a community preference for general public realm enhancements. The City conducted a geotechnical investigation of the breakwall in July 2022. Borehole samples were taken and test piles and depth probing was completed. The composition of the breakwall structure and depth of lakebed and bedrock was recorded. This information will assist the designers to complete the planning prior to construction. As project planning advances, two design solutions for the outer leg of the promenade are being pursued: a concrete deck and an elevated walkway. The elevated walkway would include a timber deck and railings. Both options include a lookout at the lighthouse, seating and lighting. The final configuration would be confirmed prior to construction. Comments on the final project concept plans can be shared on Get Involved Kingston by Jan. 31, 2022.

With the effects of climate change already impacting our community and beyond, collective action is essential for moving toward a more sustainable Kingston. There are many organizations in our community that are already working to create a more resilient and low carbon Kingston. I was pleased to bring together many of these groups at the first Climate Leadership Working Group (CLWG) meeting late last month. Our goal \u2013 to identify new opportunities for climate action, at the community level, that will help us move closer to our goal of carbon neutrality by 2040. Many of these organizations participated in the development of the Climate Leadership Plan (CLP) through the extensive community engagement undertaken throughout the process. We also welcomed some new representatives, and while they may not have been involved directly with the CLP, they have worked hard to advance climate action at an individual level and as members of their organizations. Each member of the CLWG is doing great work in our community. I invite you to review the full list of our members and if their work inspires you to act, please follow their social media, subscribe to their newsletters and share their great work with your friends and family. While the CLWG is a new group that will make recommendations on the implementation of the actions within the CLP and help us realize our goals, the Kingston Community Climate Action Fund (KCCAF) has launched for its third year! The KCCAF was established as a way to empower organizations to become part of city wide solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These organizations apply to participate in the fund, and when approved, fundraise to complete individual community climate action projects. This year, the KCCAF is seeking to raise over $110,000 to support three climate action projects.100% of all funds raised will go directly to these Kingston charities and contributions will be matched up to $5,000 thanks to the generosity of the Kingston Community Credit Union. Building climate resiliency isn\u2019t easy. It requires active participation from the entire community. The KCCAF helps organizations realize their sustainability goals by contributing funds for projects that may not be possible otherwise. It also provides an opportunity for the entire community to get involved in climate action by supporting causes that not only reduce overall GHG emissions but also offer additional benefits to the Kingston community. Among those benefits are the creation of much needed accessible daycare spaces, improved access to outdoor spaces for those with developmental disabilities and increased awareness of energy conservation in our community. Donating to the KCCAF makes a difference in more ways than one. And with that in mind, I\u2019m pleased to share this year\u2019s projects and organizations: Frontenac Club Day Care is seeking your support for building retrofits that will create 22 new licensed daycare spaces in Kingston and a new wheelchair accessible preschool and infant room. These building retrofits include the installation of two new heat pump systems in both the coach house and infant house well as spray foam insulation, improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Ongwanada is seeking your support to purchase an electric wheelchair transport bike that can be used to take the residents of Ongwanada on outdoor excursions in Kingston to help maintain their mental and physical health. The electric bike will provide the necessary support residents need while enjoying the outdoors and staying active. These bikes would reduce Ongwanada\u2019s contribution to GHGs by taking residents out for excursions in an electric powered bike instead of a fossil fuel burning van. Sustainable Kingston is seeking your support for the purchase of an electric vehicle that will replace gas powered vehicle use. This electric vehicle will be used by the Residential Energy Auditors when they perform home energy audits across Kingston, directly reducing GHGs and promoting energy conservation. We are thankful for those who have already donated in support of the KCCAF and these deserving organizations. If you are looking for a way to take real, local, and measurable climate action, we encourage you to donate to the KCCAF now through March 31. Donate online today!

Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A backwater valve, also called a backflow valve, is a device used to prevent outbound water in a home\u2019s drain pipes from re entering, or \u201cbackflowing\u201d\u2014into your home. The valve has a flap that allows water to leave but closes to prevent water and/or sewage from entering. Backwater valves are designed to close the sewer line during periods of extreme rain to prevent water from entering your home. When the valve is closed you should not use any plumbing fixtures (i.e. toilets, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines) because water will not drain and will back up into your home. The Insurance Bureau of Canada recommends residents not install the plug type valves, as they allow sewer backup pressure to build beneath your basement floor, which may cause structural damage to your home. $500 to $2,000 including installation. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. Early detection of water leakage can help you quickly determine the cause and source of the leak and address it before flooding occurs. Flood alarms, also known as, flood detectors, water alarms or water detectors are electronic devices that detect the presence of water and set off an alarm when its sensors are triggered. Flood alarms come in different shapes and sizes and with a wide range of features. New models have WiFi capabilities with smart home integration. $25 to $150 Cool roofs reflect the sun\u2019s rays and reduce heat build up through a light coloured or highly reflective roofing product such as a coating, new membrane or shingle. Most roofs in Canada are dark in colour and absorb heat from the sun\u2019s rays transferring it into the rooms below. Because cool roofs are better at reflecting the sun\u2019s energy, less heat is transferred inside your home. As a result, you may not have to use your air conditioner as much, saving you energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cool roofs also increase the life expectancy of your roof, because they reflect the heat and UV rays that damage and age roof materials. Dark coloured roofs in high density areas also contribute to the urban heat island effect \u2013 significantly warmer temperatures in urban areas compared to rural areas. As a result of climate change, Kingston is expected to see dramatic increases in the number of extremely hot days due to continued global warming. Installing a cool roof is one way to help to offset this. There are cool roof options for all types of roofs, including steep slope (pitched roofs), low slope (flat roofs).. Roofing products are tested for their reflectivity and given a Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value between 0 100. The higher the number, the more reflective it is. If you want to convert an existing roof into a cool roof, you have the following options: Green roofs are living roofs. They support the growth of vegetation and consist of a waterproofing membrane, drainage layer, organic growing medium (soil), and vegetation. Green roofs capture stormwater, improve air quality and create habitats for pollinators, birds and other wildlife. Green roofs also help insulate your home in the summer and help reduce the overall temperature in Kingston. Green roof systems are generally classified as extensive, semi intensive or intensive. Your budget, vision and the structural capacity of your building will determine which type of green roof you select. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A sump pump is a small pump that is installed at the lowest part of your basement or crawlspace that prevents flooding. The sump is the low space that collects liquids, while the sump pump detects water in the sump and moves it away from your home through a network of pipes that is dug into the floor of the basement. Groundwater can easily rise through the cracks in your foundation during long periods of rain. If there is a possibility that flooding can occur in your basement or crawl space, a sump pump will collect all of this water and redirect it away from your home. There are two types of primary sump pumps available: submersible and pedestal pumps. Submersible pumps have the motor placed underwater in your sump basin, while pedestal pumps are positioned with the pump motor out of the water, above your sump basin. It is recommended that Kingston residents consider a submersible sump pump as they are the quietest, most powerful and effective sump pump. They also allow for an airtight lid that will stop debris from falling into the pit and prevent moisture and odorous air from being released into your home. $700 to $5,000, including installation.

An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C).

For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation.

A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air. Choose an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ductless heating and cooling system to cut your electrical heating bill by up to 60 per cent, and your cooling bill by 30 per cent, depending on your climate. $2,500 to $5,000+ per unit, including installation.

If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures. Ground source heating produce less CO2 than other forms of space heating systems. $20,000 \u2013 $40,000, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Homes built after 1977 are typically more airtight, which helps to prevent heat loss but also prevents air circulation, which is important for your health and comfort. Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems.

Water heaters with storage tanks are the most common in Canadian homes, but they are not the most energy efficient. Electricity, gas or oil is used to heat water stored in the tank and supply it, as needed, to household fixtures and appliances. Storage tanks typically hold between 113 and 378 litres of water in their tanks, and this water is continuously reheated and kept hot 24 hours a day. $800 to $1,500, plus installation.

Tankless water heaters heat water as it flows, and only when required, using an electric element or gas burner. They provide endless hot water and the heat on demand feature means you only pay to heat water as you use it, instead of paying to keep a tank of water heated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. $1,000 to $2,800 Source: Natural Resources Canada", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/projects-construction/richardson-beach": "Project timeline: Fall 2021  Fall 2022 construction Richardson Beach in Macdonald Memorial Park is a favourite destination along the waterfront.

Thousands of community members came to the Tett Centre that day to celebrate the launch of this new accessible and collaborative arts hub in Kingston. That opening day also featured the presentation of a collaborative art project called The Whole Shebang that involved a cross section of local artists who came together to engage visitors and demonstrate the potential of this new facility. To celebrate its fifth anniversary, the Tett Centre tenants, project supporters, funders and community partners gathered at an event on January 30 and the Tett Centre hosted an Open House that welcomed 1,800 Kingston residents through the doors on Family Day on February 17. Both events reflected what we\u2019ve seen over the last five years, that the public is engaged and supportive of the Tett and curious to learn more and be involved in community and the arts. Photo: Susanna Gordon Photography Photo: Tett Centre If you haven\u2019t visited yet, the Tett Centre functions as a community resource that houses eight anchor arts organizations, eight artist studios and a variety of rental spaces as well as The Juniper Caf\u00e9. The Tett Centre for Creativity and Learning that operates and activates the facility is an incorporated not for profit charitable organization with its own staff and a Board of Directors and its work is supported by the City of Kingston that owns and renovated this important heritage building. The building itself originally formed part of the Morton Brewery and Distillery Company, which was built in the mid 19th century. Today, the Tett Centre is part of a one of a kind arts campus that also includes the Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts that is owned and operated by Queen\u2019s University. Very few communities have access to a resource like the Tett Centre and the journey to get here has been a long one, dating back almost 50 years. The City of Kingston actually purchased the former Morton Brewery and Distillery Complex back in 1971 when it was repurposed as the J.K. Tett Creativity Complex that housed groups like the Kingston Potters\u2019 Guild, the Handloom Weavers and Spinners and Theatre 5. For the next 30 years, the building continued to function as an informal arts cluster until 2005 when the City considered selling it. At the time, the tenant organizations within the building joined forces with the wider community to save the building from being sold and their efforts paid off. The City developed a feasibility plan in 2006 that subsequently lead to a commitment by City Council to renovate the building as a purpose built arts hub. An important idea highlighted as part of the 2006 feasibility plan is that developing creative talent with a community is critical to entrepreneurship and competitiveness as well as social cohesion and civic expression. As stated at the time, \u201ccreative capital\u201d has become a primary resource for cities looking to build prosperity and resiliency. This idea was highlighted again in 2010 as part of the Kingston Culture Plan and it continues to be recognized today as part of the Strategic Priorities of the current City Council that has identified the need to foster innovative arts, culture and social enterprises as a way to strengthen economic development opportunities. The Tett Centre embodies this idea and plays a critical role in creating creative capital, cultural vitality and creativity in Kingston. Today, the City of Kingston continues to provide funding and facility support but it\u2019s the responsibility of the Tett Centre for Creativity and Learning staff, board and tenants to offer Kingston residents and visitors with access to this unique facility. Their efforts activate the building and make it a place for people to be creative, to learn and to gather together through a shared interest in the arts. In the past five years, tens of thousands of people have passed through the doors at the Tett Centre as members of the tenant organizations, participants in classes, workshops and events and as patrons of The Juniper Caf\u00e9. The building has also become popular as a rental space with exhibits taking place in the Community Gallery, performances happening in the Rehearsal Hall and weddings being held in the Malting Tower. There are so many ways to get involved with the Tett Centre but, first and foremost, it is a place to \u201cexplore, create and be inspired\u201d. Getting to this point has taken a lot of work, and hasn't always been easy, but the Tett Centre has been a resounding success and it has also emerged as a model facility other communities are looking to emulate. The Tett Centre is one of only a handful of examples in Canada of a successful, community driven space dedicated to the arts. There is much to celebrate in this moment, not the least of which is that this experiment in municipal/community collaboration has established a solid foundation from which to build creative capital over the next five years and hopefully for many more years to come.

I've been with the City since 2009 and one of my first tasks was to develop the Kingston Culture Plan\u2014a first for the City of Kingston. Since that time, I've had the chance to work with people across the community who like me share a passion for making sure Kingston's cultural life is vibrant, enjoyable and accessible. Kingston hasn't always been home but it's certainly where my passions first emerged. Like many people, my family moved to Kingston when my father took a job at Queen's University. That was in 1973 when Kingston celebrated its Tercentenary. Kingston then hosted the sailing competitions as part of the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, which was a proud moment and inspired all kinds of cultural activities. As a young person, I felt inspired to get involved in the cultural life of the city and those early experiences set me on a path that included lots of different creative pursuits and I eventually went to Queen's University to study art, art history and drama. During those years I also worked in the Grand Theatre box office and volunteered as a tour guide at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre before moving on to Toronto to pursue a graduate degree in Museum Studies. For many years I worked in public galleries in and around Ontario and, with every job, it was always important to me to find ways to help people connect with art and history in different and interesting ways. That's something I now get to do every day in my role as cultural director with the City of Kingston and it excites me to be able to use this blog to share stories to help show some of the ways in which people are working to foster creativity, to learn, to share and to continue to feel proud about Kingston and all the things it has to offer that makes it so unique.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/explore/culture-history/culture-blog?p_p_id=com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet_delta=5&p_r_p_resetCur=false&_com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet_cur=1": "Showing 1 to 5 of 14 entries.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/transit/service-alerts/-/asset_publisher/3OOFJ6cPLiji/content/2020-08-31-tsa-princess?_com_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_3OOFJ6cPLiji_assetEntryId=38665761&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cityofkingston.ca%2Fresidents%2Ftransit%2Fservice-alerts%3Fp_p_id%3Dcom_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_3OOFJ6cPLiji%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview": "2020 08 31  TSA  Princess Starting Monday, August 31, and continuing until further notice, the Express stop on Princess Street at Albert (north side) will be shifted to an accessible temporary stop one block west (on Princess at Nelson north side) to accommodate construction on adjacent property.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/transit/bus-schedules/route11": "Route Notes: * Service ends here 6:14 a.m. 6:29 a.m. 6:45 a.m. 6:55 a.m. 7:00 7:15 7:45 7:55 8:00 8:15 8:45 8:55 8:59 9:14 9:45 9:57 9:59 10:14 4:45 p.m. 4:57 p.m. 4:59 p.m. 5:14 p.m. 5:45 5:55 6:00 6:15 6:45 6:55 7:00 7:15 7:45 7:55 8:00 8:15 8:45 8:55 9:00 9:15 9:45 9:55 10:00 10:15 10:45 10:55 11:00 11:14* Route Notes: * Service ends here 6:17 a.m. 6:32 a.m. 6:40 a.m. 7:15 7:30 7:40 8:15 8:30 8:40 9:15 9:30 9:40 10:14 10:30 10:40 5:14 p.m. 5:30 p.m. 5:40 p.m. 6:15 6:30 6:40 7:15 7:30 7:40 8:15 8:30 8:40 9:15 9:30 9:40 10:15 10:30 10:40", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/article-display/-/asset_publisher/VePzQlLkmo0v/content/article-2023-planning-application-fees?_com_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_VePzQlLkmo0v_assetEntryId=39815975&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cityofkingston.ca%2Farticle-display%2F-%2Fasset_publisher%2FVePzQlLkmo0v%2Fcontent%2Farticle-2023-planning-application-fees": "Article  2023 Planning Application Fees Additional Fees will be charged as per the Development Engineering Review Table Category 2 Fee will be applicable for the following minor variance applications: Cash in lieu of parking payment is to be as per the Cash in Lieu of Parking Bylaw (2022 63) Includes Administration Fee and 3 hours of Staff Review/Inspection Valid only if a Tree Permit is renewed 30 days before original expiry date The term \"Minor Application\" shall apply to: (i) the rezoning of a residential building with four units or less which conforms to the Official Plan and will be contained within the walls of an existing structure; or, (ii) the rezoning involving a change in non residential use which conforms to the Official Plan and will be contained within the walls of an existing structure.

Since 1997, the City has undertaken a number of projects to protect and improve the environment at Belle Park. The City continues to work with the Ministry of Environment and the community to design and implement a long term solution for Belle Park \u2014 solutions that will protect the environment, be publicly acceptable and be financially sustainable. Belle Park (also known as Cataraqui Park) is a landfilled marshland area that extends into the Kingston Inner Harbour from the west shore of the Cataraqui River to Belle Island. The site is approximately 44 hectares (108 acres) in size. Citizens, businesses and institutions in the City of Kingston used this site as a municipal landfill from 1952 to 1974. After the landfill was closed in accordance with Ministry of the Environment requirements, the City developed the site into a multiple use recreational facility that includes a nine hole golf course, tennis courts, and walking paths. Golf operations ended in 2017. In 1996, the City completed the first Environmental Impact Study of Belle Park to determine site conditions, assess risks to park users and the natural environment and recommend measures to control environmental impacts. As a result, several important projects were completed, including: Later, in 2006 the City completed an evaluation of long term management alternatives for the closed landfill. This work resulted in the current environmental management model that uses groundwater control pumps, phreatophyte tree plantings and site monitoring to protect the adjacent Cataraqui River. Belle Park is also included in Kingston\u2019s Project Track down \u2013 a joint effort between the City and the Province in 2005 to identify potential sources of PCB contamination in advance of a small river sediment clean up project at Emma Martin Park.

The Planning Act, the Heritage Act and the Municipal Act all contain provisions governing the development review process, how land uses are be controlled and who controls land development and uses the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) requires all land use planning decisions to be consistent with provincial policy. Land use policies and development requirements are set out in the City's Official Plan and Zoning Bylaws. The Planning Act requires a Municipality to have an Official Plan. An Official Plan guides City Council in its decisions about how lands in the City should be used and how growth and change should occur over a 20 year horizon. Zoning Bylaws implement the policies in the Official Plan. Zoning Bylaws contain specific provisions to regulate the use of land, lot sizes and lot development standards. If a development proposal does not conform to the requirements of the Zoning Bylaw, a building permit cannot be issued. Information about the City's Official Plan and Zoning Bylaws and copies of the documents can be obtained at the City's Planning & Development Department, located at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. The Planning & Development Department is responsible for reviewing and providing a recommendation to Council regarding development applications. The timely processing of applications requires co operation from and co ordination with numerous internal and external stakeholders, including the applicant. The development review process includes the following main steps. Not all steps are required for every application \u2013 for example, for some applications there is no requirement for a public meeting, and in some cases, the approval authority has been delegated by Council to staff. Please select a heading from the following menu for more information: The City welcomes and encourages comments regarding the development review process. Council's adopted priorities include an emphasis on customer service excellence, building an \"open for business\" culture, and enhancing service by streamlining the development review process. There are many ongoing customer service initiatives related to the development review process. The following Council Report 12 268 provides information about the status of these initiatives. The Final Report of the Mayor's Task Force on Development also outlines a number of recommendations for improving the City's development review process. Required forms and information: Pre application meetings are a mandatory part of the development review process for applications for Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw Amendments, Site Plan Control, and Draft Plans of Subdivision and Condominium. Pre application for Committee of Adjustment applications (consents and minor variances) is arranged with the Planner assigned to deal with these applications. Please contact the planner of the day by calling 613 546 4291 ext. 3180. Pre application meetings are held every third Tuesday morning at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. View the meeting schedule. At the Pre application meeting you will meet with staff from City departments (e.g. Planning, Building & Licensing, Engineering and Utilities Kingston) and external agencies (e.g. Conservation Authority). At the meeting, the required approvals, supporting studies (e.g. traffic impact, tree preservation, stormwater management, parking, noise), drawings and other information to be submitted with an application will be identified. Any technical issues that will need to be addressed will also be identified. The submission requirements and application fees will be confirmed by the assigned Planner on the Development Application Pre Application Meeting  Study and Plan Identification List) that is provided to you following the meeting. While the intent of the pre application meeting is to identify all requirements related to the proposal, on occasion additional information/studies may be required based on staff's review of your formal application submission and further project details. Proposals discussed at pre application are confidential until a formal application is submitted. The City no longer accepts paper based applications \u2013 we have gone digital using DASH! All planning applications are now made through our DASH portal. Links to tutorials and guides are also available to assist users with making their application. Planning staff are always available to provide assistance with submissions at the customer service counter at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. For all applications the following information must be provided in order for the application to be submitted through DASH: Note: Planning, Building & Licensing Services collects the Planning and Engineering fees as part of the initial application submission. Some external agencies (e.g. Conservation Authority and Health Unit also charge fees for reviewing development applications and you are responsible for paying those fees directly to the commenting agency. The assigned Planner will review the completed application form and accompanying information to determine if the application is complete. The processing of an application may be delayed until all required information has been submitted. Poor quality plans and supporting reports or incomplete information submissions will result in delays in the processing of an application. If you have any questions regarding the studies or supporting information that is required for a complete application you should contact the Planner assigned to your file at pre application. When your application has been reviewed and it is confirmed that your submission includes all the required information, a Letter of Complete Application will be provided to you. While the municipality has 30 days under the Planning Act to make this determination, it is done as soon as possible. If the application is not complete, a Letter of Incomplete Application will be provided to you outlining the additional information, reports or studies that are required. If you disagree with the City's assessment of the completeness of the application you should contact the assigned planner to discuss this. If agreement is not reached, the Planning Act provides 30 days for you to make a motion to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal for a determination on the matter and the Tribunal's decision is final. When all required information has been submitted, a Letter of Complete Application will be issued. The City is required to provide a Notice of Complete Application within 15 days after the Letter of Complete Application has been issued for Official Plan, Zoning Amendments and Plans of Subdivision. Whenever possible, the City combines the Public Notice of Complete Application and the Public Meeting Notice (discussed further below), provided that the notice requirements for both can be met. If that is not possible, then the Notice of Complete Application will be given separately in order to meet the legislative requirements, and the Notice of the Public Meeting will be given later. Any timelines mandated by the Planning Act for a decision on your application(s) start once an application has been deemed complete. For some applications (Site Plan Control and Committee of Adjustment) the timeline starts upon receipt of the application and required information, but there is no requirement to issue a notice of complete application. The planner assigned to your file will circulate your application together with the appropriate plans and studies to various City departments and external agencies, typically within 5 working days from complete application receipt. Depending on the application type and location of the property, the circulation list may include City Council, the District Councillor, municipal departments (e.g. Planning, Building & Licensing, Engineering, Utilities Kingston, Parks, Fire & Rescue, Transportation, etc.), external agencies (Kingston Economic Development Corporation, Conservation Authority, Health Unit), school boards, abutting municipalities (e.g. Loyalist Township, South Frontenac Township), utility companies (e.g. Hydro One, Bell, Cogeco, Union Gas, Trans Canada Pipelines), railway companies, provincial ministries (e.g. Municipal Affairs, Housing, Environment and Climate Change, Natural Resources and Forestry) and federal departments (e.g. Parks Canada, Fisheries and Oceans, Canada Post). Responses to the initial technical circulation are required within 10 working days from the date of circulation (30 days for plans of subdivision) and within five working days for subsequent circulations (15 days for plans of subdivision). Responses received are reviewed and consolidated by the assigned Planner, The Planner also provides comments based on their review of the technical comments and planning policy and site design. These comments are forwarded to you and/or your agent. Where there are a significant number of responses, a meeting may be arranged with you and / or your agent to review the comments to ensure there is an understanding of the issues and any additional information to be provided. You are then responsible to respond to the staff / agency comments and submit any required additional information and revised drawings to the assigned Planner, who then re circulates the material to the appropriate departments / external agencies. As needed, the assigned Planner will also work with you and arrange meetings with departments or external agencies to address technical comments or concerns. Complete re submissions that address all of the technical responses are key to enabling the various departments / agencies to fully review the revised drawings and updated information in the context of their previous comments and provide a response within the requested time frame. This process of applicant submission, City review / comment and applicant re submission continues until such time as all departments / agencies have signed off on the proposal. Approval of applications for Site Plan Control, Final Plan of Subdivision and Consent has been delegated by Council to staff. However, the procedures governing Council's delegated authority provide for a \"bump up\" to a Committee or Council for final approval. In the case of an application for Site Plan Control or Final Subdivision approval, Council is circulated the applications and a motion of Council is required to \"bump up\" the application to Planning Committee or Council respectively. Where a Consent application is \"disputed\", the application is referred to the Committee of Adjustment. The procedures also provide that staff or the applicant can also request a \"bump up\". This could occur if you disagreed with one or more of the municipal conditions of approval or where there is disagreement between staff and the applicant respecting required works. If there is a \"bump up\" request, the timelines for processing the application will be impacted given the need for preparation of a staff report to the applicable Committee or Council and consideration of the application at a Committee or Council meeting. The Planning Act requires that at least one public meeting be held for applications for Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw amendments, Draft Plans of Subdivision / Condominium and Committee of Adjustment applications (\"disputed\" consents and minor variances). The Act sets out the notice procedures (form, content and timing) and the people to be notified. Where applications are being processed concurrently, one consolidated public meeting will be held for all the applications. The City provides formal notice of the public meeting by both first class mail and the posting of signage on the subject lands. You are responsible for preparing and/or installing the required sign in accordance with the City's signage specifications. Courtesy notice is also posted on the City's website and is included on the City page of the newspaper. Where the matter affects large areas or the entire municipality, Notice is published in the newspaper. Notice of the public meeting must be given: There is no requirement to hold a public meeting or provide formal public notice for Site Plan Control (SPC) applications, applications for Final Subdivision / Condominium approval, or applications to Lift Part Lot Control and Remove a Holding Symbol. The City's procedures require that a sign is posted on the property for Site Plan Control and Committee of Adjustment applications. For these applications you will be provided with a sign to post on the property by the planner assigned to your file. The Planning Committee typically meets on the 1st and 3rd Thursdays of each month and the Committee of Adjustment meets the 4th Monday of each month. At the public meeting, you or your agent are expected to make a presentation describing the proposed development, summarizing any key studies and reports and providing the rationale for the applications. Staff may then supply any supplementary information as well as a brief summary of any public input received. Committee members may ask you questions for clarification. Interested members of the public may make written submissions to the Committee or appear before the Committee to comment on the application or ask questions. Once all public input has been received, you or your agent is given an opportunity to respond to the comments and summarize the application. After this, the public meeting is closed. In some cases an application may be amended following the public meeting in response to technical comments or issues identified by the public or the Committee. Depending on the nature of the changes, a second public meeting may be required. A second public meeting could also be required if the notice for the public meeting was not provided properly. Following the public meeting, Planning Committee, at a second Planning Committee Meeting, will consider a comprehensive report and make its recommendation to Council. Following the public portion of a Committee of Adjustment meeting, the Committee discusses and makes a recommendation on the application. Following the public meeting, the assigned Planner will prepare a comprehensive report to Planning Committee. This report will include an analysis of the proposed development and the applicable policies and bylaws, a summary of submitted reports or studies, a discussion of the issues raised in any of the technical responses and at the public meeting (including any specific matters identified by Committee members), and a recommendation to the Committee whether the application should be approved or rejected. If the comprehensive report recommends approval of the application, any conditions to the approval will be included (e.g. conditions of draft plan approval) together with a draft of the proposed Amending Bylaws (Official Plan and / or Zoning Bylaw). The draft conditions and amending by laws will be circulated to you and your agent for review and comment prior to finalizing the report. The time required to prepare the Comprehensive Report will depend on the complexity of the project, the type of application, the nature of public input received, any identified technical matters, and the need for any additional information from the applicant. In some cases, particularly for large developments or ones that have become controversial, the City may require some of the supporting studies to be peer reviewed. A peer review is an independent review of the study submitted by a qualified professional in that field of study. Typically studies such as market impact or environmental impact studies for large developments are peer reviewed. You are responsible for the cost of the peer review. Once the comprehensive report is drafted by the assigned Planner, it is reviewed/approved by management staff in Planning, Building & Licensing and then forwarded to the Commissioner of Community Services. The report is then submitted to the clerks department for inclusion on the Planning Committee agenda. All reports are also reviewed/signed by the Chief Administrative Officer. Some reports may also require sign off by other Commissioners. The comprehensive report and recommendations will be considered during a regular meeting of the Planning Committee. During the Planning Committee's discussion of the application, questions may be directed to staff respecting the report or recommendations and members of the public will have the opportunity to provide oral comments. The Committee may recommend to City Council that the application be approved with or without changes to the staff recommendation and draft Bylaws or that the application be denied. In some cases, based on the Committee's discussion, the application may be deferred or referred back to staff until additional information is received, either from you or staff. Planning Committee's recommendations are forwarded to City Council for approval. The Planning Committee Report is considered by Council in open session and Council may adopt the Committee's recommendation, amend it, reject it or refer it back to the Planning Committee or staff for further consideration / information. If an application is approved by City Council, the amending Bylaw respecting Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw amendments will be given all three readings and passed at that City Council meeting or a Draft Plan of Subdivision may be approved . After the Committee of Adjustment or City Council makes a decision on an application, the Planning Act requires that Notice of that decision be issued. The Act prescribes the form of the Notice, the timing for issuing the Notice, and the persons to whom the Notice must be given. For Committee of Adjustment applications, Notice respecting a minor variance application must be given not later than ten days after the decision is made, and for consent applications, within 15 days after the decision is made. The Notice includes information on the approved variances and land severance together with any conditions imposed by the Committee. The Notice also sets out the final day for any appeals to be submitted. For all Committee of Adjustment decisions, the City typically provides Notice within 2 3 days following the decision. For applications for Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw amendments and Draft Plans of Subdivision / Condominium, Council must give Notice within 15 days from the date of the decision or passing of the amending Bylaw. The Notice of Adoption (Official Plan amendment), Notice of Passing (Zoning Bylaw amendment) and Notice of Decision (Draft Plan) include information on the Bylaw amendments (location, purpose and effect) as well as the conditions of draft plan approval. The Notice also sets out the final day for any appeals to be submitted. In most cases, the City provides the required Notice within 7 \u2013 10 days following the decision. If no appeals to the Committee / Council decisions are received, the decisions are final and come into effect. The Planning Act provides for an appeal process for decisions on planning applications. Any person with an interest in the matter may appeal a decision of the Committee of Adjustment or Council to the Ontario Land Tribunal provided that they made a presentation at the public meeting or provided a written submission prior to the decision being made. The appeal must be filed within the appeal period as set out in the Notice and must identify the portion of the decision being appealed and the reasons why. If an application is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the final decision will be made following a Tribunal Hearing. For more information on the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, refer to the Citizens' Guide created by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. You can apply for your building permit at 1211 John Counter Boulevard. A building permit is your formal permission to begin construction or demolition. It means that the City of Kingston has reviewed the plans for any new structure, addition or renovation. Your plans must comply with the Ontario Building Code, local Zoning Bylaws, and other applicable laws and regulations. At the building permit stage the City will collect the applicable development charges and impost fees. Building permits regulate the type of construction allowed and help to ensure building standards are met. The building permit process protects your interests, as well as those of the community and helps to ensure that any structural change is safe, legal and sound. By obtaining a permit, you can also take advantage of the professional expertise of Building Division staff. Inspectors are good sources of information and can offer suggestions to help solve construction problems, often before they occur.

Unlike other forms of housing assistance, the benefit is tied to the household and not a physical housing unit, allowing the benefit to move with the household to any rental unit within the City of Kingston (the City) or County of Frontenac (the County). As a result, recipients will have more flexibility to choose where they live to be closer to family, social support networks, schools and employment opportunities. Households must meet the following criteria to be eligible to begin receiving a PHB: Households are selected in the same manner they are for traditional RGI units. A waitlist will be maintained for PHBs. When there is an available benefit because a household leaves the program or more program funding becomes available, a new household will be selected from the PHB waitlist by the same rules that RGI units are offered. The benefit is calculated using a formula that is generally consistent with Schedule 4.1 of Ontario Regulation 367/11 under the Housing Services Act, 2011 (HSA). The formula includes average market rent (AMR) and adjusted family net income (AFNI). Monthly Portable Housing Benefit = (Average Market Rent x 80%)  [ (Adjusted Family Net Income x 30%) / 12 ] Interaction with Social Assistance: Monthly Portable Housing Benefit = (Average Market Rent x 80%)  [ (Adjusted Family Net Income x 30%) / 12 ] , OR; Monthly Portable Housing Benefit = Actual Market Rent  Maximum Shelter Allowance Note: The lesser of the two calculations will be used. The amount of a PHB is based on the difference between 80 per cent of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Average Market Rent (AMR) for an appropriately sized rental unit, based on household composition, and 30 per cent of annual household AFNI divided by 12. AMR is defined as the average expense of market rent in the City and the County, as provided by CMHC to the City based on CMHC\u2019s annual rental survey. AMR is a standard measure used in other housing programs and the City updates AMR information annually. The program only uses AMRs for unit sizes of bachelor, one bedroom, two bedrooms, three bedrooms and four bedrooms. Recipients will receive a monthly benefit based on a calculation using a unit size no smaller than a bachelor and no larger than four bedrooms. Households requiring more than four bedrooms will receive a benefit based on a calculation using AMR for four bedrooms. The current AMRs for Kingston are: Yes. Households must file their income tax return by July 1 of each year to continue to be eligible for the benefit. Households do not normally have to move to receive a PHB. Households can use it to pay rent where they are currently living as long as they reside in the City or the County. If a household does not live in the City or the County, they can apply for a PHB but will need to move to the City or the County to start receiving it. Once a PHB offer has been accepted, households have 90 days to secure a rental unit. If a household lives in an RGI unit, they will need to move out of the RGI unit before they can start receiving a PHB. Households will have 90 days to move out of the RGI unit.

It takes the cooperation of our bus operators and our customers, to make each ride a safe and enjoyable experience. Passengers using mobility aid devices have priority. This policy ensures riders keep the front seats open for those who need them the most. The Courtesy Seating Area is intended for passengers with mobility limitations and disabilities, and for seniors. Customers using wheelchairs and scooters have priority in the Courtesy Seating Area. All passengers must vacate these seats when wheelchair and scooter users need this space. This designated area is marked on the bus with the logo shown here (above right): If available, passengers with other needs \u2013 such as caregivers travelling with a child in a collapsible stroller; pregnant women; and passengers travelling with a collapsible bundle buggy \u2013 may use this designated area provided they vacate this space for passengers with mobility limitations and disabilities and seniors. Passengers using wheelchairs and scooters should board the bus last to allow other passengers to be seated. The bus operator will then secure wheelchairs and scooters in the courtesy seating area. As a courtesy, please allow seniors and passengers with disabilities to board the bus first. Strollers, buggies, luggage and other large articles must not obstruct aisles. It is the caregiver's responsibility to secure the child and stroller. Customers are required to carry on and carry off their own items. Pets are permitted to board all buses, however, all pets must be placed in a locked carrier. Pets must be transported in carriers designed for the transportation of animals. The maximum size / dimensions permitted is 28 in L x 20.5 in W x 21.5 in H. Cardboard boxes and cloth bags are not acceptable carriers for animal transportation and are therefore not permitted. The pet carrier must always be kept with the passenger (on the rider\u2019s lap, under a seat or between a standing rider\u2019s legs) and must not occupy a seat. The carrier must be kept clear of the aisle and doors. Please read our Pet Policy for full details. Passengers with disabilities using service animals (or a person training a service animal) will continue to access Kingston Transit in the same manner. Service animals are not required to be transported in animal carriers. A service animal is on duty when being used for reasons related to a person's disability. In accordance with the Smoke Free Ontario Act and Smoking Bylaw 2002 231, smoking is prohibited on all transit vehicles, inside bus shelters, and within nine metres of bus shelters located at transfer points. The use of electronic cigarettes is also prohibited on transit vehicles, inside bus shelters, and within 9 metres of bus shelters located at transfer points. Do not use profane or discriminatory language while on the bus. Respect is a mutual thing. Kingston Transit is committed to providing a safe trip for our riders and a safe working environment for our bus operators. We ask that you treat our bus operators and buses with respect. Our bus operators do their best to ensure that passengers arrive at their destinations safely and on time. However, road construction, inclement weather or traffic congestion may occasionally impact route schedules. Your patience and understanding during these circumstances are appreciated. Have you had a memorable experience with a bus operator? Let us know by providing operator feedback. When paying by cash, exact fare is required for depositing into the fare boxes. Only coins are accepted. Bus operators do not carry change. Passengers can transfer between routes for free with any fare payment option chosen. Transfers are valid going in one continuous direction from origin to destination within 60 minutes from time of issue. Riders paying with coins must request a printed paper transfer from the bus operator upon boarding the bus. When boarding the next bus with the transfer, riders must scan the bar code on the printed transfer at the fare box which validates the transfer. Retain your transfer if you need to travel on multiple buses to arrive at your destination. The transfer can be used only by the person to whom it was issued. Riders using electronic disposable or reloadable smart cards need only to scan their cards at the fare box when boarding. Transfers are automatically stored on the smart cards. The smart technology will identify that you boarded another bus and will not charge your card for another ride. Each Kingston Transit bus is equipped with a bike rack which accommodates two bicycles at any one time. Passengers may secure their bikes for no additional charge. This service is for non motorized, two wheel bikes only with wheel diameter between 20 and 29 inches (700c) and a maximum tire width of 2.35 inches. It is the rider's responsibility to load and unload the bicycle from the bike mount. Bike racks are available year round. Stay behind the yellow line so the bus operator has a clear view of the doorway and mirrors. When seats are not available, make sure you hold onto stanchions and straps if you are standing while the bus is in motion. Sudden stops, bumps and jolts do happen so be prepared and be safe. For your safety, do not walk in front of the bus; wait until it leaves. To ensure the bus operator sees you while waiting for the bus at a bus stop, signal or wave at the Bus Operator that you are waiting for the bus. When it's dark, consider using your cell phone display or flashlight to signal the bus operator. At major bus stops, more than one bus may arrive at the same time. If the bus approaching is not your bus, take a step back to let the bus operator know that you are not waiting for that bus. Please walk to your bus when it comes to a complete stop. Express buses do not stop at all bus stops but only at those designated as Express bus stops. Do not attempt to stop a bus after it has pulled into traffic. Bus operators are not permitted to open doors or allow passengers to board away from bus stops. At different times, the bus operator may make announcements regarding safety, transfer connections, detours and/or regular operations. Listen for these announcements and the automated \"next stop\" announcements; and be aware of your surroundings and watch for your stop. Having difficulty hearing an announcement? Report an issue with the announcement system. If you carry a backpack or tote, please remove it from your back/shoulder so that when you turn around, you don't injure another rider. To allow more riders to board the bus: when standing, place your backpack/tote on the floor or in front of you. When seated, place your backpack/tote on your lap. Backpacks/totes and large parcels should not prevent another rider from being seated. The use of mobile devices is permitted, as long as the user's volume is at an acceptable level and does not disturb other riders or the bus operator. Listening to a music device with earphones is permitted. Keep the volume down at an acceptable level to not disturb other riders or the bus operator. When the bus is crowded, please move to the rear of the bus so more passengers can board. We don't want to leave anyone behind. If you ride Kingston Transit regular routes after dark, you can request a stop closer to your destination. Simply tell the bus operator in advance where you wish to disembark and he or she will drop you off as close as safely possible to your final stop, at a point along the established route. When riding Kingston Express routes, requests are permitted after 8 p.m. at existing marked regular and express stops only along the established route. As safety is our main concern, lengthy and unnecessary conversations can distract the bus operator and are prohibited. Avoid using scented products as they can aggravate allergies. Shirts and footwear must be worn to board the bus or the bus operator will refuse service. If you are coming from the beach or pool, please make sure your clothes are dry when boarding. Wearing in line skates, roller blades or ice skates, or use of a skateboard is not permitted on any bus or in bus shelters. You may carry skateboards and skates (with skate guards secured) onto the bus. Light snacks are permitted, however all food and beverages must be properly contained. Please take all litter off the bus and dispose responsibly or use the litter bins available where provided on the bus.

The awards honour landscape architectural firms whose projects feature distinctive design and sustainable landscape management. The design for Breakwater was developed by Claude Cormier et Associ\u00e9s. \"I'm very pleased that Breakwater Park is receiving due recognition at the national level. I remain proud that the federal government was a partner in this waterfront rejuvenation, which has been so clearly enjoyed by residents of all ages and will continue to be for generations to come,\" says Mark Gerretsen, Member of Parliament for Kingston and the Islands. \"Breakwater Park has proven to be a tremendous success since its reopening last summer. This park is an incredible asset situated on Kingston's beautiful waterfront with features that the whole community can enjoy. We love Breakwater Park and it's an honour to see it recognized with a national award,\" says Bryan Paterson, Mayor of Kingston. \"The thousands of people who flocked to the new Breakwater Park and swimming pier show how important this space is to the community. Stunning architecture has elicited a profound response. This project changes the way other cities are looking at waterfronts and restoration projects. If they follow Breakwater Park's example, the result will be healthier, more active communities and swimmable water for all,\" says Mark Mattson, president, Swim Drink Fish. The 15 winning projects from across Canada demonstrate excellent practice in a multidisciplinary approach in planning and design. In the award citation, the CSLA noted: \"Breakwater Park is a project in three parts: the revitalization of an existing park, a redesign of shoreline infrastructure, and an expansion into a neighbouring terrain vague with a derelict post industrial dock transformed into Canada's first deep water urban swimming pier.\" Breakwater Park underwent extensive renovations, which were completed in 2018. The project was supported by approximately $900,000 in funding through the Canada 150 Community Infrastructure Program, delivered by the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario). The renovations were also funded with $500,000 by The W. Garfield Weston Foundation and Swim Drink Fish Canada. Breakwater Park was identified as the highest priority for improvements in the City's Waterfront Master Plan, which was awarded a CSLA Award of Excellence in 2017.

Be aware of the type of training, socialization and exercise that will be needed and be sure that you are able to provide all of these things for your pet. Once an informed decision is made, it is important that you get your new pet from a rescue organization (such as the Kingston Humane Society) or a breeder that is both credible and humane.

The Park sits on lands previously used by tannery and smelting operations, but is now a public park beside a rowing/canoe club and the beautifully restored Woolen Mill \u2013 now a commercial building hosting many successful businesses. Contaminated soil and groundwater The site's industrial past left it with contaminants in its soil such as arsenic and other metals that required a management approach that prevents contamination of the river through the seepage of contaminated groundwater moving through the soil. ZVI PRB Wall bench tests resulted in a 99.98% reduction in concentrations in a month The City incorporated an innovative approach to groundwater remediation (filtering) that reduced the arsenic concentrations in the groundwater by 99.98% to 0.0036 ppm! This entirely effective solution also proved to be 40 per cent more cost efficient than the more traditional \"Dig & Dump\" method, which moves the problem elsewhere and requires more time and energy to remediate the soil and groundwater. The City installed an underground Zero Valent Iron Permeable Reactive Barrier (or ZVI PRB) Wall, which basically filters and cleans the groundwater. More specifically, it absorbs dissolved arsenic to iron hydroxides as groundwater filters through it and undergoes electrochemical reduction. The ZVI PRB Wall is constructed of several layers of material consisting of (top layer, first): A lower cost, less disruptive sustainable solution This method required far less soil to be removed \u2013 about 230 metric tonnes in total with the ZVI PRB Wall versus 1,000 metric tonnes with the \"Dig & Dump\" method. This saved the fuel, time and energy associated with hauling 50 full dump truck loads of contaminated soil three hours away and hauling in 50 full dump trucks of clean replacement soil. That's a savings of about 17,000 litres \u2013 or more than $23,000 worth \u2013 of fuel plus associated labour and equipment costs. This method also reduced disposal and backfill costs and minimized the disruption to park and area users.

Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to find items that are broken or not working properly. Use the checklists below to make sure your home is free of fire hazards \u2013 and that you are able to exit it safely and quickly in an emergency. Housing checklist: It is best to know in advance what safety equipment is provided by the landlord. You need to determine if this is a significant issue that needs reported immediately (like a missing or non working smoke alarm), or a routine maintenance item that can be included on your checklist and fixed in the next week or two. Kingston Fire & Rescue suggests it is a great idea to get renters insurance! This is an inexpensive insurance policy that may assist you in the event of lost possessions, fire or if you cause damage to others, even by accident. Some parent's homeowner's policies may also provide some protection for students living on campus. Food on the stove and grease fires are all too often the reason for emergency calls responded to by Kingston Fire & Rescue. The vast majority of cooking related fires are as a result of unattended cooking. Cooking related fires are VERY preventable with some awareness to cooking basics. Late night cooking is dangerous when the chef is drunk or otherwise impaired. When you are impaired, you are easily distracted or can fall asleep allowing the food to cook unattended or the heat source to remain on. Another hazard is created when fires occur and are extinguished by the occupant who then doesn't notify the fire department. The smoke alarm may be disabled to silence the noise and the occupants think everything is okay and go back to sleep. When these fires are not extinguished completely, they can spread unknowingly to nearby combustibles or to the cupboards above the stove. Never disable a smoke alarm.

The full report and supporting reports can be downloaded below. It should be noted the Urban Growth Strategy's conclusions, recommendations and means of implementation were approved in principle by Council on July 14, 2004, and the study was used in the development of the City's new Official Plan. On April 15, 2014 a report was presented to Council with respect to the City's Urban Growth Boundary Update. The purpose of this report was to provide an assessment of the status of the City's current urban boundary and to recommend appropriate urban residential growth as well as the appropriate servicing infrastructure to support the future growth. The Urban Growth Strategy study began in June 2002. It was the first comprehensive review of the growth issues faced by the amalgamated City of Kingston. The Official Plans prepared by the three former municipalities were based upon independent approaches to development. However, with the new City, there is a need for a single, unified concept to guide decisions on City wide issues. This Strategy provides an integrated approach to coordinated growth management of the City for the next 25 years (i.e. to 2026). The population of the City of Kingston grew from about 90,000 to 114,000 between 1976 and 2001 and was projected to increase to between 147,000 (medium projection) and 164,000 (high projection) in the next 25 years. The Urban Growth Strategy has evaluated where and how this growth should be accommodated, using a logical step by step process: Evaluation Criteria (Table 1) were established and confirmed through a public consultation program. The criteria were applied to the Growth Alternatives, and Growth Alternative 2 was identified as the most preferred. The criteria were not applied to the CDA since growth there is already considered to be the first priority. The evaluation process and findings were presented to the public in April 2003. This process is described fully in Interim Reports No. 1 and No. 2. Council directed that an additional Growth Alternative (GA 1A) be considered and that an additional servicing cost analysis be completed. This analysis examined the impacts of infrastructure costs on municipal revenue sources: taxes, water/sewer rates, impost fees and development charges. Following the additional analyses, Growth Alternative 2 (GA 2) continues to be preferred for development, in addition to the CDA. Although GA 1A was similarly ranked, GA 1A is federal land and is not currently available for urban development. The Urban Growth Strategy also examined the issues affecting how development should occur. This included considerations such as the urban boundary, phasing, commercial development, \"smart growth\", density, infilling, alternative development standards, Kingston's Greenhouse Gas Reduction commitments and related issues, many of which were raised by the public during the community consultation process. The results of this study will be implemented through City decisions on development applications, locations for new municipal facilities and through the four project deliverables which are found in the appendices. They include: The 17 numbered recommendations of this study are in Sections 4 and 5 of the Final Report. They, in turn, lead to the Urban Growth Strategy, which is described in Section 6. The major recommendations of the Urban Growth Strategy focus on four initiatives: This combination of broad initiatives, combined with the detailed recommendations of the Water and Sewer Concept Plans and the Financial Plan, will help the City to implement this comprehensive Urban Growth Strategy. The Urban Growth Strategy Study's conclusions, recommendations and means of implementation were approved in principle by Council on July 14, 2004. There were subsequently two public meetings held in 2005 on draft Official Plan Amendments. They were held on July 21, and November 17, 2005. Following a working session with the Council, early in 2006, staff were instructed to include the Urban Growth Strategy policies into the new Official Plan which was being developed. Following the consideration of a series of updates, reports and evaluations the final Urban Growth policies and mapping schedules were included in the Official Plan which was adopted by Council on July 19, 2009.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/mayor-and-council/district10": "Conny is a business owner and healthcare professional with over 25 years of experience in ergonomics, disability management and wellness.

It\u2019s the single most important thing you can do improve the energy efficiency of your home and should be the first step of any retrofit project. You can save up to 30 per cent of your energy costs by air sealing areas where energy loss occurs. Air sealing impacts the building envelop of your home. The building envelop is the physical separator between the conditioned and unconditioned environment, including the resistance to air, water, heat, light, and noise transfer. Older homes typically have more air leaks, around windows and doors, electrical outlets, and cracks in the foundation and walls. You can seal air leaks in your home with weather stripping and caulking or by applying gaskets and tapes. $200 \u2013 $1,500 Source: Natural Resources Canada In addition to providing security, energy efficient doors prevent air and temperature leak from the house. Doors come in a variety of materials, some of which reduce heat flow better than others. Depending on the style and type of insulation, for example, metal clad doors can be more efficient than solid wooden doors. No matter what the material, ill fitting doors lose energy and can make your home drafty and uncomfortable. $200 or more per door. Source: Natural Resources Canada Insulation helps keep outdoor air from getting inside your home. It also prevents indoor air from escaping. For maximum energy efficiency, attics should be sealed, insulated, and ventilated. Air leaks in your attic will cause substantial heat loss and lead to a variety of moisture related problems in your home. $1.50 to $3.50/sq. ft. Source: Natural Resources Canada A basement can account for about 20 per cent of a home\u2019s total heat loss. Adding insulation to your basement is important whether or not space will be finished. For optimal energy efficiency, your home should be properly insulated from the roof down to its foundation. Much like your attic, basements need to be sealed, insulated, and ventilated. Proper insulation not only reduces heating and cooling costs but also improves comfort. The materials used to insulate your basement will depend on your foundation and whether you need to insulate inside or outside of your home. $6,500 to $18,000 Walls can account for up to 20 per cent of heat loss in your home. In addition to heat loss through your walls, cracks and penetrations may allow uncontrolled air leakage into and out of your home. Insulation is designed to prevent heat or sound from being transmitted from one area to another. It works by trapping pockets of air and slowing down the in/out process. The type of insulation you need will depend on the type of walls (i.e. solid, concrete block, frame) in your home. You can install one or more of the following: blown in, rigid board, batt/blanket and spray foam insulation. $150 to $3,000, plus installation.

The fourth flag recognizes the ongoing vibrancy of the M\u00e9tis Nation of Ontario in this region. The Franco Ontarian flag symbolizes a shared commitment toward the Francophone community of Kingston and serves to acknowledge the historic French roots of the city. The Anishinaabe First Nations flag features a thunderbird (Animikii) at the center. According to traditional stories, this powerful, spiritual animal is said to create the sound of thunder just by the flapping of its wings. The bird is also a protector with the ability to bring rain that nurtures and cleanses the earth. Commonly known as the Six Nations Confederacy flag, the Haudenosaunee flag is made up of purple shells, the belt represents each of the original five nations (Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk nations) and is read from right to left. The first symbol represents the Mohawk, followed by a symbol representing the Oneida. At the center is the Great Tree of Peace, which represents the Onondaga. To the immediate left of the tree is the symbol for the Cayuga, followed by the Seneca. Each symbol is connected, representing the union of the nations. The Huron Wendat flag represents its culture, territory, and history. The symbol on the flag is accompanied by belts of wampum. The Bustards (large terrestrial birds) recall one of the most important beliefs of the Huron Wendat Nation: the creation of the world. While Y\u00e4a\u2019taenhtsihk (Skywoman) fell from the celestial world, bustards gathered it on their wings and placed it on the carapace of Grande Tortue, the chief of the animals. The Great Turtle eventually became a wonderfully beautiful island, our Earth. Canoeing and Snowshoeing represent the means of transport used for travel on the territory.

The decision to install a traffic signal is based on Ministry Transportation Ontario (MTO) guidelines that consider traffic volumes, delays, pedestrians and collision history. The cost to install a new traffic signal can range from $150,000 to $220,000. There are two types of cameras that may be seen on poles throughout the City \u2013 traffic counting cameras and vehicle detection cameras. Traffic counting cameras are used to conduct detailed traffic counts that include pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles. A traffic counting camera is strapped to a pole adjacent to an intersection and typically remains in place for only two to three days. The digital film is uploaded and processed by a company in Waterloo called Miovision and the traffic counts are sent back to the City. City staff do not have the ability to view the digital film and the public's privacy is respected at all times. Vehicle detection cameras that improve the efficiency of intersections have been installed at many traffic signals in the City. These cameras detect the presence of vehicles and allow traffic signals to respond to changes in the traffic volumes by varying the length of green lights. For example, cameras on Alfred Street at Concession Street allow the traffic signal on Concession Street (a very busy street) to remain or \"rest in\" green until a vehicle is detected by the cameras on Alfred Street. If only one or two vehicles are waiting on Alfred Street, the camera will cause the traffic signal to operate a short green light. At busier times of the day, the camera will allow the traffic signal to operate a longer green light for vehicles on Alfred Street. At all intersections outside of the downtown core, if cameras are not in place, magnetic loops imbedded in the pavement detect the presence of vehicles and allow the length of green lights to vary with traffic volumes. The vehicle detection cameras are not recording information and the City does not have the ability to watch traffic at this time. When traffic signals are co ordinated, they are timed such that stops and delays for motorists are minimized as much as possible. Some of the factors that affect signal co ordination are vehicle speed, distance between intersections, congestion and the variable length of green lights on the main street and on the side streets. As traffic signals are usually co ordinated for the posted speed limit, motorists driving well above or below the speed limit may find that they arrive at more red lights. Ideal or \"perfect\" signal co ordination is usually possible on one way streets such as Brock Street and Johnson Street. On two way streets, perfect co ordination is usually not possible for both directions of travel. For example, if the traffic signals along Gardiners Road are timed so that northbound vehicles always arrive at green lights, then the southbound vehicles would have to stop at several red lights and vice versa. Where traffic volumes are relatively similar in both directions, the traffic signals are timed so that the \"red light arrivals\" and \"green light arrivals\" are balanced as best as possible in both directions. When the traffic flow is much heavier in one direction, the signals are co ordinated to favour the flow of the highest number of vehicles. Although left turn arrows do benefit turning vehicles, they increase delays for other vehicles using the intersection. As there are only so many seconds of \"green time\" in an hour, the operation of a left turn arrow requires \"stealing\" green time away from another direction of travel. In many instances, vehicle volumes are so high in other directions that it is not desirable to take time away to make the left turn arrow longer. At some intersections, more time can be added to the left turn arrow in order to reduce delays. At many intersections however, we need to work within a specific \"cycle length\" in order to keep the signals coordinated and working together along a corridor. For example, the cycle length along Gardiners Road during the afternoon peak period is 125 seconds. This means that the amount of time it takes to display all greens, ambers and reds in all directions is 125 seconds from start to finish. If 5 seconds is added to a left turn arrow, 5 seconds must be taken away from another direction so that the cycle length is still 125 seconds. Often the other directions are even more congested than the left turn lane being considered so we choose not to extend the length of the arrow. The design of traffic signal timings, especially during the busy periods of the day, is a delicate balancing act. In order to maintain co ordination between a specific group of traffic signals, each traffic signal within the group must operate the same \"cycle length\". The cycle length is the total number of seconds required to service all the directions of traffic once and includes green arrows, green lights, amber lights and red lights. Cycle lengths in the City of Kingston vary from 70 to 130 seconds. If more green time is added to one direction, the same amount of green time must be taken away from another direction so that the cycle length remains the same. For example, if the length of the green light for northbound and southbound vehicles on Gardiners Road at Taylor Kidd Boulevard is increased by 10 seconds, then a total of 10 seconds must be taken away from another direction of travel such as the east/west movement on Taylor Kidd Boulevard or time could be take away from a left turning arrow. As these other directions of travel can also carry high volumes of vehicles, it is important to balance the delays for all users of the intersection. If all of the green lights at an intersection were simply made longer, the cycle length would have to be increased. Motorists would get longer green lights but would have to wait at longer red lights in order to get those green lights. This would result in increased delays and longer vehicle queues. In order for traffic signals to respond to changes in demand, the City has vehicle detection loops, buried underneath the pavement, or vehicle detection cameras at the majority of signalized intersections outside of the downtown core area. The \"magnetic inductive loops\" under the pavement respond to the metal content in vehicles and \"tell\" the traffic signal controller to extend the length of the green light when the vehicle demand exists. Vehicle detection is ideal at intersections where vehicle volumes fluctuate throughout the day as they reduce delays and improve the overall efficiency of the intersection. For example, if there is detection near the stop bar of a left turn lane and no vehicles are present, the left turn arrow should not be displayed. By contrast, if there is a long queue of vehicles in the left turn lane, the green arrow will stay on as long as vehicles continue driving over the detection zone to a programmed maximum number of seconds. At busy intersections, motorists may notice that the length of the green arrow often reaches the maximum time before all of the turning vehicles are serviced. Drivers approaching an amber signal indication are required by law to stop unless the stop cannot be made safely. Under ideal circumstances, a motorist sees the amber signal and has adequate time to come to a comfortable stop. In some cases however, motorists are caught in the \"dilemma zone\" and must quickly determine if they are able to come to a comfortable and safe stop or if they should continue through the intersection. To separate the vehicle movements for all directions of travel at traffic signals, a clearance period between opposing green lights must be provided. This clearance period typically includes 3 to 5 seconds of amber time in addition to an average of 2 seconds of \"all red time\" when all vehicles at the intersection have a red light. The City does not operate traffic signals in flash mode (amber flash on the main street and red flash on the minor street) during quieter hours of the day for the following reasons: In flash operation, there is no pedestrian protection since the pedestrian lights no longer function. Since pedestrians could be crossing at any time of the day or night, it is still important to maintain a consistent level of protection for pedestrians. If all of the traffic signals along a major corridor are in flash operation, motorists on the main street would face a flashing amber light at every intersection. Since the flashing amber provides the right of way to that direction and requires no stopping, a \"drag strip\" effect could be created since motorists would soon learn that they could drive the entire length of a corridor without stopping. When signals are in flash mode, motorists can become confused with respect to who has the right of way. This confusion can lead to an increase in collisions. For this reason, vehicle detection is used such that traffic signals typically \"rest in green\" on the main street and only turn red when a pedestrian, cyclist or vehicle is detected on the side street. The walk light indicates when it is safe for pedestrians to begin crossing. The duration of the walk light may be as short as seven to ten seconds but can often be greater when the duration of the green light for vehicles is relatively long. The walk light display is followed by a red flashing hand known as the \"clearance phase\". The duration of the clearance phase is dependent on the width of the road being crossed. If a pedestrian steps off the curb and begins crossing just as the red hand starts flashing, there should be adequate time for the pedestrian to finish crossing. If the flashing red hand appears when you are only part way across the street, you should continue crossing as there is still adequate time to clear the intersection. If a pedestrian starts crossing after the red hand starts flashing, there may not be adequate time to cross safely. Pedestrian countdown devices are useful at signalized intersections since they let pedestrians know how exactly many seconds they have left to cross the road. The City is currently installing pedestrian countdown devices at most major intersections. Although pedestrian signals are designed for pedestrians, not vehicles, drivers often look at these lights as an advance warning tool. If a driver is approaching an intersection where the signal ahead is green and the walk light is on, the \"clearance phase\" for pedestrians has not begun. A driver then knows that the green light ahead is not going to change to amber for a little while longer. If a driver approaches an intersection where the signal ahead is green and the red hand on the pedestrian fixture is flashing, the driver does not know when the light will change as the duration of the clearance phase is different at every intersection. The pedestrian countdown devices are timed to allow pedestrians enough time to cross the street. In the downtown area, the traffic signals operate with \"fixed timings\" meaning that the length of the green lights stay the same throughout the day and do not respond to changes in the traffic flow. At these downtown signals, the \"zero\" on the pedestrian countdown is always displayed at the same time as the amber for vehicles. Outside of the downtown area, all of the traffic signals are programmed to respond to changes in the traffic flow. For this reason, the length of green lights is variable so the \"zero\" on the pedestrian countdown does not always correspond to the amber for vehicles. Where pedestrian countdown devices are in operation, motorists should be aware that the when the countdown reaches \"0\", it may or may not correspond to the beginning of the amber light for vehicles. Drivers therefore need to focus on the traffic signal intended for vehicles as opposed to the signals for pedestrians. At intersections with pedestrian push buttons, it is very important for pedestrians to push the button so that the walk light will be displayed and so that enough time will be provide for the pedestrian to cross the street. Pedestrian push buttons are installed at intersections where the required minimum vehicle \"green light\" time may be less than the required pedestrian crossing time. For example, if only two cars are detected on a sidestreet, the length of the green light required for those vehicles may only be 10 seconds. If a pedestrian needs to cross at the same time as those two vehicles but doesn't press the button, the pedestrian will only get 10 seconds to cross the road. If the pedestrian pushes the button, the length of the green light will automatically be increased from 10 seconds to whatever amount of time is required for a pedestrian to cross that particular street. In order to reduce delays and red light arrivals, the traffic signals along most major corridors in the City are co ordinated and timed to work with adjacent intersections. Since high volumes of traffic on major roadways take priority over lower volumes of vehicles on the intersecting minor road, vehicles on the minor street must often wait until the main traffic movement on the major street has travelled through the intersection. Effective January 1, 2016, the City must install audible pedestrian signals for visually impaired people at all new and rebuilt traffic signals where a marked crosswalk is present. Requests for audible signals at existing traffic signals may be forwarded directly to the traffic division for consideration.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/committees-boards/arts-advisory-committee": "The Arts Advisory Committee is an avenue of communication and consultation between the arts community (art, music, dance, performance, literature, film, craft and other arts) and the municipal government.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/committees-boards/arts-advisory-committee/": "The Arts Advisory Committee is an avenue of communication and consultation between the arts community (art, music, dance, performance, literature, film, craft and other arts) and the municipal government.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment-sustainability/environmental-improvement-projects/belle-park-landfill/remediation-progress-report": "Since 1997, the City has spent over $5 million building and operating a number of remediation controls (projects) at the former Belle Park landfill site including: The City has remained committed to working with the Ministry of the Environment and the community to manage the Belle Park site in a manner that is publicly acceptable, environmentally responsible and financially sustainable.

The following flowcharts illustrate the steps involved in each process: View the Planning and Development Map and select the second residential unit tab. The City is offering the Second Residential Unit Affordable Housing Grant Program to stimulate homeowner investment to create alternate housing options within the City. To complement existing affordable housing programs available within the City, the grant program is now being offered to allow homeowners to participate in the creation of additional modestly priced rental housing within the City. Participants of the program must commit to renting the suite: Provided these two requirements are met, there are no other conditions or requirements on who can rent the suite. For additional information, including how to apply and program requirements review the program guideline. The grant provides a forgivable loan of the lesser of $15,000 or 75% of the costs associated with developing a second residential unit. Funding will be provided to owner occupied households who create a second residential unit and commit to providing the unit at an affordable rental rate to an income qualified tenant household for a minimum five year affordability period. Developing affordable housing is one of the City\u2019s top priorities. The City is committed to developing as a sustainable community.

The plan's study area consists of approximately thirty six city blocks, and the project will involve the replacement of roughly nine kilometres of urban streets and sidewalks from building edge to building edge detailed in an annual work plan spread over multiple years. In some sections, the underground utility infrastructure is 200 years old and has never been subject to a comprehensive underground infrastructure replacement program. Kingston is not unique in this regard, as deteriorated underground infrastructure is an issue in cities across Canada. While the study boundaries reflect the mixed use downtown business district, the study identifies different character areas within the downtown. These are the Princess Street commercial streetscape, the Historic District between Brock and Johnson Streets, the redevelopment lands of the North Block and Block 'D' and, lastly, the Waterfront. The conceptual designs for Princess Street, the Historic District, Confederation Park, and Boucher Park and the Waterfront directed the development of layout patterns and a palette of streetscape elements for each of the character areas. In order to encompass the physical character of the public open space, the study's scope includes lighting, public art, sidewalk cafes, signage, phasing, a financial plan and analysis of the closure of Ontario Street at Confederation Park. This presents a unique opportunity to co ordinate various aspects of the public open space network into a complete vision. As a result, the plan will be useful in directing incremental changes and small projects, as well as, major projects staged over the next 10 15 years. The design approach was based on three key concepts \u2014 clarify, complement and integrate. To a large extent, the aspect of clarification is based on the analysis of existing conditions, which resulted in the identification of four individual character areas within the downtown. The intent was to complement intrinsic qualities of each of the character areas. This resulted in recommendations for the arrangement of material palettes and elements as variations on a theme within the downtown. These recommendations are intended to enhance and work in harmony, rather than compete or distract from the existing heritage quality of the area. Similarly, the various streetscapes, parks and waterfront should be integrated, with the overall vision of supporting and improving the economic viability and quality of the downtown environment.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/resident/better-homes-kingston/assessments-upgrades-retrofits/choose-a-contractor": "It is your responsibility to compare contractors.

It\u2019s what makes Kingston a great place to live and it also makes it an attractive place to visit and to do business. In the days and weeks since our Country, Province and City declared states of emergency in response to COVID 19 we have seen so much of what we take for granted close down in an attempt to slow the transmission of COVID 19 and to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d. These measures are necessary and are working well here in Kingston as Dr. Kieran Moore recently shared with City Council at its meeting on April 21, 2020. We\u2019re lucky people are responding as needed during these unprecedented times and its remarkable how the community is stepping up to help in different ways as well as to recognize the efforts of our frontline workers whose work is so indispensable. We are witnessing history in the making and it\u2019s important we remember what\u2019s happening for future reference. In this moment, museums across Canada are actively documenting what life is like during COVID 19. Examples of these efforts were explored in a recent article published online through the CBC website. It poses the question \u201cHow do you record the history of a pandemic while you\u2019re busy living through it?\u201d Museums have already begun to source items that will help them interpret in years to come what it was like to live through COVID 19. It is especially interesting because it is a rare event that is having a global impact but with especially meaningful things happening at a local level. Here in Kingston, the PumpHouse Museum was meant to open on April 3, 2020 with a new exhibition called Collecting Histories. The exhibition as originally planned was meant to explore the role objects and artifacts play in engaging and inspiring us to learn about local history. Through this exhibition the plan was to share a selection of historical, archival, archaeological and artistic works that form what we refer to as the Civic Collection. The show was also meant to look at the challenges and opportunities we face in building a collection that represents the many facets of our community experience in an inclusive way. Obviously, things have not gone as planned and the PumpHouse Museum, like many cultural sites across Kingston, will not be opening anytime soon. In response, staff are moving the Collecting Histories exhibition online and are asking Kingston residents to participate using the City of Kingston\u2019s Get Involved platform. In the coming weeks a series of engagement opportunities will be launched that will ask the community questions like \u201cWhat objects do we need to collect?\u201d, \u201cWhat stories do we need to document?\u201d and \u201cHow can we work together to shape what future generations will remember?\u201d. The Get Involved platform will be used in different ways to gather stories, capture ideas and foster discussion about what\u2019s happening. We will also be looking to work with the community to create a time capsule as a record of this moment and the site will be updated over time with new collection activities, information from the Collecting Histories exhibition and collection initiatives from our community partners. This promises to provide an interesting opportunity to be part of making history in a local context and we look forward to receiving your input regarding what is most important, including objects that should be saved and stories that should be shared. At the same time, it\u2019s still possible to continue to visit sites like the PumpHouse Museum online and to access educational resources to use with your families. The same is true of other sites across the city and we encourage you to check out  ygkmuseumfromhome for more online opportunities as we continue to stay home and stay safe.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/projects-construction/growth-infill-strategy/updates": "The final drafts of the new Kingston Zoning Bylaw and related Official Plan amendment are now online for public review.

Learn more about the Central Kingston Growth Strategy on the City\u2019s website and by visiting the Get Involved Kingston project page.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/CKstrategy": "The planning division is working on the Central Kingston Growth Strategy \u2013 a policy and regulatory framework to guide infill and intensification in the central area of the city. The study area for the strategy includes the lands within central Kingston designated residential in the Official Plan, except for those located within the North King's Town Secondary Plan and the Kingston Provincial Campus Secondary Plan: The regulatory framework recommended by the Central Kingston Growth Strategy will be incorporated into the second draft of the new City wide Zoning Bylaw, expected to be released in late 2019. Some residential areas of central Kingston have experienced a significant amount of pressure for infill development over the years that has resulted in the construction of additions and the demolition of existing buildings for the construction of larger scale residential rebuilds and intensification through the conversion of a single unit dwelling into a dwelling having two or more units. Such developments have raised public concern regarding their impact on the built form and character of the affected neighbourhoods. The project consists of three phases which will result in a set of final recommendations: At the Jan.10, 2017 meeting, council directed staff to report back on Jan. 24 on how best to word an Interim Control Bylaw prohibiting any new development of, or alterations to, one family dwellings, two family dwellings, row dwellings, group dwellings, semi detached dwellings and multiple family dwellings within the Sydenham, Portsmouth and Williamsville electoral districts. The Information Report prepared by staff for the Jan. 24, 2017 council meeting detailed: At its Jan. 24, 2017 meeting, council directed staff to undertake a land use study of the City's existing policies and regulations on residential intensification within the same area and make recommendations addressing development and/or conversion pressures to guide the future of these areas. Council also asked that a public meeting be held to receive feedback from residents on the draft Interim Control Bylaw and other policy changes and report back to council with options/recommendations in April. On Mar. 1, 2017, a public meeting was held to receive feedback on the draft Interim Control Bylaw. On May 2, 2017, a Recommendation Report was provided to council that offered: Council endorsed the staff recommendations at its May 2, 2017 meeting. The terms of reference for the Central Kingston Growth Strategy were approved by council at its Aug. 8, 2017 meeting.

Fire and life safety systems may become inoperative. You should know what to do. Please review the following information and take precautions to make sure everyone stays safe Use flashlights or chemical light sticks instead of candles or lanterns to reduce fire risks. Review the buildings' approved \"Fire Safety Plan\". Occupants must know the fire and life safety practices they must follow. The local Chief Fire Official must be contacted where applicable, to determine approved alternative measures. These measures are to be implemented for the life safety of building occupants when fire and life safety systems are inoperative or impaired. Place in secure candleholders protected by a glass chimney. Keep candles away from all combustible materials, such as draperies, papers, etc. Place them out of reach of children and pets. Avoid walking with a lit candle or taking it into a closet or similar area to look for things. Extinguish candles when you leave the room or go to bed. Never leave them unattended. Make sure that all stove elements and ovens are OFF and that nothing has been placed on top of the stove. Have at least one telephone (not cordless) that works during a power failure. Without electricity, fire and life safety systems may not operate as originally designed. The fire alarm system, voice communication system, emergency lighting, fire sprinkler system, standpipe and hose system, and other fire and life safety features rely on electricity to operate appropriately. Some fire and life safety systems are equipped with a secondary source of power consisting of batteries. When the power is depleted in these batteries, the system or equipment will no longer work. The Ontario Fire Code stipulates that such systems must be maintained in operating condition at all times. Should the power not be promptly restored or where an alternative electrical power supply is not provided, occupant safety and property are at risk from fire. Think carefully before you bring a fuel burning appliance into the building. Any device that burns fuel requires oxygen to burn properly and ventilation to remove the deadly products of combustion. Carbon monoxide is produced by any device fuelled by natural gas, propane, heating oil, kerosene, coal, charcoal, gasoline or wood. It is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas that can be deadly. Place lamps and lanterns in a secure place where they cannot be knocked over by children or pets. Keep them away from combustibles and windy areas. Refill lamps and lanterns outdoors, away from combustibles and other people. Before leaving the room, make sure that all lamps are out. Keep all matches and lighters out of sight and reach of children, preferably locked away. Portable generators should be used outdoors only. They should be carefully placed outside to ensure that fumes do dot enter the building. Generators and hot gases should be kept away from combustibles. Store fuel for the generator outside in an approved container a safe distance away from the building and generator. Refuel only after shutting it down and letting it cool. Follow manufacturer's recommendations regarding use. Hire a licensed electrical contractor or electrician to install the unit. Have the installation inspected by the Electrical Safety Authority. More information on portable generators can be found in the Outdoor Fire Safety Section. Use only portable space heaters that have been designed for indoor use. Before using one, review the manufacturer's recommendations for usage and follow the instructions carefully. Only use the fuel for which the appliance was designed. Provide adequate ventilation by opening a window slightly, when the heater is in use. Before refuelling, turn off the heater, wait for it to cool and take the heater outside to refill. Keep all heaters at least 1 m (3 feet) away from combustible materials including drapes, carpeting and furniture. Turn portable space heaters off when you are not in the room and before going to bed. If you are using a wood stove, always empty ashes into a covered metal container and store them outside, away from combustibles. If you have not used the fireplace or woodstove for a long time, have it checked by a professional technician before using it. The chimney may be blocked or damaged, which could cause a fire or a build up of carbon monoxide inside the building. Propane and charcoal barbecues should be used outside only. Do not bring them inside the building.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/emergency-services/kingston-fire-rescue/safety-prevention/outdoor": "Learn more about outdoor fire safety via the list below. Propane is stored as a liquid, but used as a vapour. The cylinder must be stored outdoors and kept upright at all times to prevent leakage. Propane, in its natural state, is a colourless odourless gas and is odorized at the refinery. The ethyl mercaptan which is added gives the propane a very strong boiling cabbage/burnt garlic smell which is detectable long before concentrations become dangerous. An important thing to remember is that propane vapour is heavier than air and therefore, if a leak should occur, the invisible vapour will \"pool\" in low lying areas. This is one of the main reasons that it is imperative that propane cylinders and tanks be used and stored outdoors only. Clause 9.5.1.2 of the Propane Installation Code (a national standard of Canada) states that \"A cylinder which contains propane liquid, or vapour, shall not be stored or used inside any structure\". Remember that a cylinder which seems empty is still full of propane vapour and still presents a hazard if it should leak. Make sure the burner holes and tubes connected to the burners are rust and debris free and that the burner throat, where the propane enters the burner, is free of dust or cobwebs. All hoses and joints should be soap tested by using a solution of dish soap and water. Leave the barbecue valve off and the cylinder valve on. Spread the soapy solution generously on all fittings and the hose. If bubbles appear and become larger or increase in number, then you have a leak. Never check for leaks with an open flame. If you're not sure about something, take it back to the dealer for help or call a qualified propane technician. The fitting that connects the barbecue hose to the cylinder has a left hand thread. Turn it counter clockwise to tighten. If the fitting has an 'O' ring, check it every time you connect the cylinder. It should be replaced if it's bent or worn.

The Nuisance Party Bylaw is limited to addressing behaviour specific to large social gatherings or parties, rather than a catch all bylaw attempting to curtail all public nuisance behaviour. By exercising the authority provided under a nuisance party bylaw, an Order can be issued by police for large social gatherings to cease and to disperse people not residing at a residence where the social gathering is occurring. Bylaws of this nature have been enacted by several Ontario municipalities, bridging the gap between existing bylaws and charges under the Criminal Code. The regulatory purpose of this concept is to create a duty upon those hosting a social event or party to control the participants, and to give law enforcement personnel a mechanism to control and disperse people where the event has become a public nuisance. Nuisance party bylaws can therefore provide additional enforcement options beyond those available under existing bylaws and statutes. Public feedback on the concept of a Nuisance Party Bylaw was considered in the drafting of the bylaw. Residents were invited to share their feedback at a public meeting, by email to staff and on the City's online engagement site, Get Involved Kingston. The Nuisance Party Bylaw was enacted by council on March 20, 2018. On August 11, 2020, Council approved the use of Administrative Monetary Penalties (AMPs) to more effectively address nuisance behaviours across the city. Learn more about AMPs on the Bylaw Enforcement webpage. City staff are preparing an information brochure for local landlords outlining the steps they can take to deter nuisance party occurrences on their premises. Request a copy of the brochure. In addition to fines or penalties, people who conduct or host nuisance parties may be liable for fees from Kingston Fire & Rescue, Kingston Police and/or municipal bylaw officers for attending the scene. The current fee is $90 per officer, per hour (or part thereof). Failure to pay these fees could result in civil Court action or recovery through a collections agency. The purpose of the Nuisance Party Bylaw is to create an enforcement tool to address the negative impacts of large social gatherings involving nuisance behaviours, such as public intoxication, property damage, and excessive noise. Yes. Under the current Nuisance Party Bylaw, it is an offence to \u201cpermit\u201d a nuisance party to occur. If there is evidence that a landlord permitted a nuisance party to occur on their premises, the landlord can be charged under the Nuisance Party Bylaw. The current Nuisance Party Bylaw also provides for the delivery of a warning notice to the landlord after a nuisance party occurs and prohibits the landlord from permitting a subsequent nuisance party to occur on the premises within two years. The increase in both number and severity of large nuisance parties in Kingston poses a significant risk to health and safety and places a strain on community partners and emergency services, such as Kingston Police, Kingston Fire & Rescue, Frontenac Paramedics and hospital staff. It is incumbent upon landlords, as property owners and neighbours, to do their part to deter dangerous nuisance party behaviours from occurring on their premises by taking reasonable proactive steps (and not relying on a warning notice from the City before taking action). The warning notice provision was also intended to educate landlords during the implementation of the Bylaw. As of 2022, the Nuisance Party Bylaw has been in effect for over four years in the City of Kingston and it is expected that all landlords in the City have familiarized themselves with the content of this Bylaw and its requirements. Under the proposed bylaw, a landlord is only guilty of an offence if there is evidence that the landlord \u201cpermitted\u201d or \u201callowed\u201d a nuisance party to occur at their property. Similarly, a landlord is only responsible for the fees and charges set out in the proposed bylaw if there is evidence that the landlord \u201cpermitted\u201d or \u201callowed\u201d a nuisance party to occur. There are several steps that landlords can take to demonstrate that they have not \u201cpermitted\u201d or \u201callowed\u201d a nuisance party to occur, including: The intent of the proposed bylaw amendments is to ensure that landlords are fulfilling their obligations as property owners and neighbours to act with due diligence in deterring nuisance party occurrences on their property. Those who fail to do so could be held legally accountable under the Nuisance Party Bylaw. The intent of the proposed bylaw amendments is not to penalize landlords who have taken reasonable steps to educate their tenants on the City\u2019s Nuisance Party Bylaw and to deter nuisance party occurrences on their property. No. A landlord is not required to commence eviction proceedings against its tenants to demonstrate that it has not \u201cpermitted\u201d or \u201callowed\u201d a nuisance party to occur at its property.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/bylaws/nuisance-party-bylaw/university-district": "Historically, Kingston has struggled with recurring unsanctioned street parties that have drawn thousands of people to the University District. Unsafe and disruptive behaviours often accompany these parties and put the community at risk by putting a significant strain on emergency services and creating dangerous situations when roads and traffic are blocked. In an effort to curb these behaviours and their effects, the City of Kingston, Kingston Police and Queen's University have collaborated to introduce the University District Safety Initiative. The pillars of this initiative include: Those charged for committing an identified offence (see list in \"What type of behaviour is the UDSI intended to address?\" answer below) during Orientation week, Homecoming weekend and St. Patrick's Day \u2013 or for any offence under the Nuisance Party Bylaw \u2013 could now be issued either a Part I Court Summons or Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP). Individuals issued a Part I Court Summons will need to appear before a Justice of the Peace in Kingston, regardless of where they live, and will not have the option to settle the charge by mail, online or by phone. The goal is to ensure that people charged with an offence account for their actions in person. Because of the COVID 19 Pandemic and the associated risks that nuisance behaviours could pose to the Kingston community, Council introduced AMPs as a more responsive approach to addressing nuisance behaviour. Any resident who is charged under the City\u2019s Nuisance Party or Noise Bylaws could be issued a ticket that must be paid through the City instead of the Provincial court system. Learn more about Administrative Monetary Penalties. In addition to fines or penalties, people who conduct or host nuisance parties may be liable for fees from Kingston Fire & Rescue, Kingston Police and/or municipal bylaw officers for attending the scene. The current fee is $90 per officer, per hour (or part thereof). Failure to pay these fees could result in civil Court action or recovery through a collections agency. While both have similarities and may overlap, they are distinct enforcement tools. The regulatory purpose of a nuisance party bylaw is to create a duty upon those hosting a social gathering or party to control the participants' behaviour and be responsible for any actions as a result of that behaviour. The pillars of the University District Safety Initiative are changes in how people are charged at certain times of the year (and under the Nuisance Party Bylaw year round), potential university related non academic consequences for any Queen's University student charged, and information sharing between the city, police and the university. The purpose of the program is to ensure all accused persons account for their actions to a Justice of the Peace and that Queen's also has an opportunity to review the behaviours of its students in these instances. The City will enact the University District Safety Initiative from 12 p.m. on Oct. 14 to 12 p.m. on Nov. 1. Kingston Police and Bylaw Enforcement have the discretion to enforce the initiative city wide. The name of the initiative identifies the neighbourhood that has historically been the site of the problematic gatherings targeted by the initiative. No. The identified offences, including any offence under the Nuisance Party Bylaw, are regulatory offences prosecuted in the Provincial Offences Court. Even if you are convicted of the offence, you will not have a criminal record. Fines issued under the Nuisance Party and Noise Bylaws can be processed by the Provincial Offences Court system (under the Provincial Offences Act). In this case, when a person receives a ticket, they may request a trial and have the matter adjudicated in court. Due to the COVID 19 Pandemic, operations at the provincial level have been suspended. Instead, under the AMP process: The individual who is alleged to contravene the bylaw receives a penalty notice, instead of a Provincial Offences Act ticket. The individual may appeal to a screening officer. If not satisfied by the decision, the matter can then be referred to an external hearing officer for a final decision. The external hearing officer\u2019s decision is final. Learn more about Administrative Monetary Penalties. Yes. Kingston Police and Municipal Enforcement Officers will discretion to issue fines under either the Provincial Offences Act of Administrative Monetary Penalty process. If the infraction is a repeat offence, posses significant risk to the community or is under the Nuisance Party Bylaw, a Part One Court summons may still be issued. Below is a list of offences that the initiative captures: Nuisance Party Bylaw 2018 53 Liquor Licence Act Noise Bylaw 2004 52 No. The identified offences included in this program involve behaviours that are, and always have been, against the law. The Initiative attempts to identify and deter the problem behaviours exhibited frequently in the University District during these specific times of year (and year round under the Nuisance Party Bylaw). No. If you are in the University District while the initiative is in effect, you can only be issued a summons if you are engaged in one of the behaviours outlined in the list of identified offences. If you are engaged in a behaviour on the list of identified offences, a warning and/or summons may be issued and is subject to the discretion of municipal enforcement and police officers. The pilot program was re evaluated in the spring of 2019. Kingston City council adopted the initiative as a permanent program on July 9, 2019. People who are issued a Part I Summons will have their names posted on a public court docket. This information will be shared with the university in order to identify those individuals who are Queen's students. Queen's students will be identified and assessed as appropriate through the university's student code of conduct system.

Roundabouts have the potential to reduce collisions, traffic delays and fuel consumption resulting in improved air quality through reduced vehicle emissions. Safety: Roads entering a roundabout are gently curved to direct drivers into the intersection and help them travel counter clockwise around the roundabout. The curved roadway, lower speeds and one way travel around the roundabout eliminate the possibility for T bone and head on collisions. Environment: The reduced stopping, idling, accelerating and decelerating at roundabouts creates lower emissions compared to traffic signals. Efficiency: Reducing the number of cars having to stop at an intersection, increases the efficiency of the intersection compared to stop signs and traffic signals. Curves on the approach to roundabouts required all vehicles to slow down before entering. Traffic entering a roundabout must yield to circulating traffic. Once in the roundabout, drivers should not need to stop and can proceed to their exit. If you are turning right at the first exit, signal as you enter the roundabout. If you are using the roundabout to go straight through the intersection or to turn left, enter the roundabout and signal \"right\" after you have passed the exit before the one you want to use.

Building upon the current tree inventory, management practices, and annual planting programs, the plan focuses on the City's public urban forest located in the 21 per cent or 9,559 hectares of the City that are considered urban and sub urban. Public trees are located along boulevards, parks, and forests that the City owns and maintains. Effective urban forestry management that maintains and enhances trees within Kingston's urban neighbourhoods can have significant environment, social, and economic benefits for the entire community. The City's urban forest includes all trees growing individually or within woodlands, naturally or planted, on municipally owned land within the urban boundary of the City of Kingston. It includes trees in natural areas, along roads, within boulevards, in parks, and as landscaped features around residences, school yards, and commercial buildings. We are all familiar with the intrinsic value of trees; the sense of inner peace you experience on a walk in a treed park, or the relief provided by tree shade on a hot summer's day. Yet trees provide many other essential services to our community, the environment, and the economy, including removing pollutants from surface and groundwater, enhancing services provided by traditional civil engineering such as stormwater management, retention of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, and commemoration of important people and events. The Urban Forest Management Plan and its recommendations will be consistent with existing policies intended to protect and enhance trees and tree cover as set out in Kingston's new Official Plan and the Tree Bylaw. It will also be consistent with the spirit and intent of the community's vision for the City of Kingston; \"Kingston \u2014 Canada's Most Sustainable City\" as well as with the Guiding Principles for Kingston's draft Integrated Community Sustainability Plan, called Sustainable Kingston, which recognizes the value of community well being, community ownership and participation, transparency, and resiliency as key principles for sustaining our future. Building upon the current tree inventory, management practices, and annual planting programs, the City\u2019s Public Works department will primarily implement the plan.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/about-city-hall": "Guided and self guided tours of City Hall are temporarily unavailable due to COVID 19 precautions.

The Natural Heritage Study was undertaken in 2004 to inventory natural areas parts of our city, identify environmentally significant areas and provide planners and developers with guidance on how to protect sensitive natural assets within the City of Kingston. Kingston also has an Urban Forestry Management Plan that guides how our urban trees are planned, planted and maintained. The City owns and maintains thousands of trees on public property including boulevards, parks, and forests. To ensure the health, safety, and growth of our tree canopy, the City performs routine work that could include any of the following activities: All maintenance work is performed by City arborists, who are certified with the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). Trees, particularly young trees, are vulnerable to drought. Residents can help keep Kingston's urban forest healthy by watering trees during extended dry periods. Trees need about 2.5 cm (one inch) of water per week to stay healthy. Unlike other plants and grasses, trees do not go dormant during periods of drought and need water to survive. Did you know using a hose or sprinkler to water a tree will cost less than $0.20 per week? Review the water wise guidelines below to learn more about conserving water. Conserving water is important during periods of drought.

The City\u2019s 37 road plows and 16 sidewalk plows work continuously during winter weather events to clear over 1,800 km of road lanes and 600 km of sidewalks. Road plowing is based on a priority system, with main arterial roads cleared first. Plows may do multiple passes before moving to collector roads and local residential roads. During normal winter conditions, the target to clear roads once the precipitation ends includes: Sidewalk plowing is based on a priority system, with high pedestrian volume sidewalks and sidewalks next to high volume roads cleared first. During normal winter conditions, the target to clear sidewalks once the precipitation ends includes: The City may declare a winter weather event significant after reviewing a regional alert from Environment Canada and determining that the weather in Kingston warrants such a declaration. During a significant weather event, residents will be advised to use extra caution and will be reminded winter maintenance service levels may not be met. Provincial legislation was updated in 2018 to allow municipalities to declare a significant weather event when it is expected winter maintenance service levels may not be met. A significant weather event is defined as an approaching or occurring weather hazard with the potential to pose a significant danger to the users of highways [streets] within a municipality. When a weather hazard is expected, Environment Canada will issue a regional alert. The Snowplow Tracker helps you see the progress of snowplows clearing City roads and sidewalks. Different colours on the map indicate the last time a road was plowed. Click the image below to launch the Snowplow Tracker. The Snowplow Tracker only shows plows when they are actively clearing snow. The City\u2019s plows are multipurpose vehicles and used for a variety of other activities including sanding, salting, and winter maintenance operations. Road plowing is based on a priority system. Main roads are cleared first. Plows may do multiple passes before moving on to residential areas, depending on the winter weather event. See the City\u2019s Winter Maintenance Policy to learn more about plowing priorities. Both sidewalk and road plows send frequent location updates, approximately every 15 minutes. For the road plows, the system tracks when the plow has the blade down and is in motion. For the sidewalk plows, the system tracks when the plow is in motion. Different colours on the map indicate when a road was last plowed and updates continuously with the most recent data. The City uses on street parking restrictions to respond quickly to winter weather. Plows are large vehicles, and it is safer, easier and more efficient to clear streets without vehicles parked on them.

A brownfield site may be as small as a vacant gas station with remaining underground storage tanks, or as large as several hundred acres of abandoned factory that may have dumped waste on its property during its operation. Kingston, like many municipalities, has a number of brownfield locations. Often these sites are vacant land and/or abandoned buildings that were located in a City's core area and were once part of the economic viability of the community. Until recently very little has been done to revitalize brownfields. However, the Provincial Government has passed the Brownfields Statutory Law Amendment Act that encourages the revitalization of contaminated land and makes other amendments relating to environmental matters. The City of Kingston is also interested in the remediation of brownfield sites and, as directed by Council, formed a task force to review and develop a strategy for the remediation and redevelopment of brownfield lands. Due to environmental contamination, or perceived environmental contamination, the redevelopment of brownfield sites can be complicated by added costs, time or add an element of uncertainty to a redevelopment project. Therefore, banks would not lend money to developers for the purchase and/or remediation of these sites and developers were reluctant to accept this responsibility and the added costs. As a result new industries, developers and lenders avoid sites that once provided economic viability and jobs to the City of Kingston. Currently, brownfields development is occurring in Europe, the United States and other municipalities in Canada with a high level of success. There are great economic benefits for remediating brownfield sites. It often allows development in areas already serviced by roads, water, sewers and other hard service infrastructure. Often, brownfield sites are in prime areas of the municipality and would generate higher tax revenue once redeveloped. Brownfield sites that were once considered eyesores within the community would become improved and redeveloped for use by the community, which revitalizes the area and creates new jobs.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/committees-boards/inactive/municipal-heritage-committee": "The City's Municipal Heritage Committee is comprised of two members of Council and a group of ten volunteers with various levels of experience and knowledge in archaeology, heritage conservation and city cultural planning and a passion for conserving the City's rich cultural heritage resources.

For the purpose of creating a connected system, the plan included the west limit of the City at Collins Bay to St. Lawrence River near Abbey Dawn Road, and northerly along the Great Cataraqui River to Kingston Mills Lock station. The implementation plan includes 3 main streams of projects including signature projects, major projects and minor projects. Some of the signature projects include renovation to: For information about planned works and completed projects, view the Latest Updates page.

The Williamsville Main Street is an area that has seen a great deal of change over the last few years. The study examines existing land uses and redevelopment potential in the area, creates a concept plan and urban design guidelines for future development, and provides recommendations regarding transportation, servicing and the cultural heritage in the area. The Williamsville Main Street Study was approved by Council on February 21, 2012. In November 2020, staff completed an update to the Williamsville Main Street Study, which included a review of the land use and built form policies and zoning provisions for development along the corridor, including locations for taller buildings and greater density. This work was supported by a detailed transportation study and a review of the available servicing capacity. On December 1, 2020, Council passed amendments to the Official Plan and the zoning by law to implement the update to the Williamsville Main Street Study.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/pay?p_p_id=kingstonpaymentsportlet_WAR_kingstonpaymentsportlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=_118_INSTANCE_mIrojY3TeRAO__column-1&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=2&_kingstonpaymentsportlet_WAR_kingstonpaymentsportlet_render=payments&_kingstonpaymentsportlet_WAR_kingstonpaymentsportlet_ProductId=poa2103&l=fr": "Veuillez entrer les renseignements suivants tels qu'ils apparaissent sur votre \u00ab Avis d'amende et date d'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00bb.

Controlled pedestrian crossings are locations where motorists and cyclists are required to yield the right of way to pedestrians. They involve a combination of signage, pavement markings, and in some cases, signals or flashing beacons. Visit Get Involved Kingston to see the engagement for Pedestrian Crossing locations. See a map of existing pedestrian crossings. Pedestrian crossovers, also known as PXOs, are marked crosswalks where vehicles must yield to pedestrians crossing the road. They are identified by specific signs and pavement markings. Pedestrians: Motorists: Cyclists: The Pedestrian crossover (PXO) Type B includes overhead and side mounted signs, pavement markings, and a rapid rectangular flashing beacon (RRFB) and push buttons that can be activated by pedestrians. Examples of this type of PXO in Kingston include the crosswalk on Rideau Street in front of Rideaucrest Home and at King Street in front of Kingston General Hospital. The PXO Type C includes side mounted signs, pavement markings, and a rapid rectangular flashing beacon (RRFB) and push buttons that can be activated by pedestrians. The PXO Type D includes side mounted signs and pavement markings, including a ladder crosswalk and a 'yield to pedestrians' marking for motorists. An intersection pedestrian signal (IPS), also known as a \"half signal\", provides a legal crossing for pedestrians across a major roadway. An IPS consists of traffic signal heads for vehicles on the major street only along with signalized pedestrian fixtures and crosswalks. Vehicles approaching the intersection from the side street are controlled by a stop sign. These signals have been installed at a number of locations in Kingston including on King Street at the Tett Centre, King Street at Beverly Street and on Bath Road in front of Frontenac Secondary School. Pedestrians: Motorists and Cyclists: Pedestrians must push a button to activate the walk indicator, which is followed by the flashing hand display. Vehicles on the major roadway must obey the IPS signal and vehicles on the side street must obey the stop sign. After coming to a complete stop, motorists may turn onto the major roadway when it is clear and safe to do so. Vehicles must yield the right of way to pedestrians crossing the main or side streets and to vehicles travelling along the major street. A mid block pedestrian signal (MPS) consists of traffic signal heads for vehicles on the major street along with signalized pedestrian fixtures and crosswalks. Since MPS are installed between intersections, there is no side street traffic. As with an IPS, pedestrians must push a button to activate the walk indication and vehicles on the roadway are subject to the same regulations as at any full traffic signal. Sidewalks are paved paths (concrete or asphalt), generally installed adjacent to roadways, that allow pedestrians to walk in a dedicated area. Off road trails are separated spaces typically through a natural area or corridor that accommodates pedestrians and cyclists. The surface type can range from natural surface to asphalt depending on the location. Both portions of the Waterfront Trail and the K&P Trail are examples of off road trails. In boulevard trails are a separated space found within the boulevard of the roadway \u2013 in place of a sidewalk, which accommodate both pedestrians and cyclists in a shared space. In boulevard trails can be either uni or bi directional. The Bath Road Bikeway is an example of an in boulevard trail in Kingston. Pedestrian priority crossings give priority to the crossing needs of people on foot (and those using mobility devices). They are often called scramble crossings because of the way they allow pedestrians to scramble across the intersection in any direction on the all directions walk signal. The scramble signal at Union and University will operate 24/7 and will stop vehicular traffic in all directions during the scramble phase. In order to further improve pedestrian safety, vehicles will not be permitted to make a right turn on a red light at any time at this intersection. Pedestrians When the walk signal is displayed in all directions, pedestrians can cross to any corner \u2013 even diagonally. This is indicated by the diagonal crosswalk markings and all directions walk signals at the corners of Union Street and University Avenue. Pedestrians may still cross in the direction of traffic when vehicles have a green light and motorists making a left turn or right turn must still yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk as usual. Cyclists Cyclists must dismount and walk their bicycles if they want to cross on the pedestrian priority/scramble signal. Cyclists who do not dismount their bicycles are legally considered vehicles and must obey vehicular traffic signals, including the right turn on red ban. Motorists Motorists are not permitted to proceed in any direction during the scramble crossing \u2013 when the all direction walk signal and all direction red traffic signals are displayed. Motorists should expect increased delays at the intersection since the red lights will be longer in order to accommodate the pedestrian priority/scramble crossing. When the green light is displayed, motorists can proceed as usual and travel straight through the intersection or turn left or right when safe to do so.

He was re elected in 2018, and on Oct. 24, 2022, he was re elected for a third term as Mayor. He first ran for City Council in 2010 in Trillium District. In this role, he used his background as an economist to push forward a progressive agenda centered on growth and quality of life initiatives. As Mayor, Bryan's vision is to establish Kingston as an innovative and forward thinking city. This vision aims to harness the incredible assets we have as a community and build a culture of collaboration to make Kingston a leader among cities. In his first term as Mayor, Bryan championed the construction of the Third Crossing, the expansion of Kingston's airport, and the revitalization of Breakwater Park, while also welcoming several new international businesses to the city. In his second term, Bryan focused on fostering innovation and entrepreneurship through the Mayor's Innovation Challenge and the new economic development strategy, increasing the supply of housing in the city with the Mayor's Task Force on Housing, and ensuring the Third Crossing was built on time and on budget, all while managing the community impacts from the global pandemic. In his third term, Bryan remains focused on addressing housing affordability and reducing homelessness through creative community partnerships and other levels of government. He will prioritize new spaces to accommodate growth for new businesses and housing and push for greater regional co operation among neighbouring municipalities to help increase transportation initiatives and foster economic development. He plans to promote food security and sustainability initiatives, find creative ways to bring more family physicians to Kingston and ensure annual tax rate increases remain one of the lowest among other cities in Ontario. Bryan moved to Kingston in 2000 to attend Queen's University as a graduate student. In 2006, after obtaining his Master's and PhD in Economics at Queen's, he joined the economics faculty at Canada's Royal Military College in Kingston where he continues to work as an Assistant Professor.

The Plan recognizes that the City is made up of a wide variety of urban, suburban, agricultural and rural land uses as well as a number of defining environmental features. It serves as the blueprint for how the City will grow over the next 20 years and will assist in making Kingston Canada's most sustainable city. The Official Plan also provides a framework for establishing the City\u2019s zoning bylaw to set local regulations and standards, for example, those related to how land or buildings are used, where buildings can be located, the height of buildings, etc. The Official Plan for the City of Kingston came into effect on January 27, 2010. Official Plan Amendment Number 50, being the five year update of the Official Plan, came into effect on August 29, 2017.

The Planning Act requires that municipalities in Ontario adopt an Official Plan that is consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement. It is intended to guide development in Kingston until 2036, but will be reviewed every five years in accordance with the requirements of the Planning Act and may be amended by the City to reflect changing circumstances or new priorities for resource protection, growth or redevelopment. The Official Plan consists of both written policy and attached maps. It is organized into 10 main sections. The Plan is organized to move from fundamental and broadly based planning principles, and strategic policy approaches of the City to the more specific land use policies, resource and utility policies, implementation tools, and then to secondary plans and specific policy areas, which are more detailed provisions for specific geographic areas of the City. The Official Plan is the main tool for ensuring that future development and redevelopment are properly managed and directed to appropriate locations within the municipality. Without an Official Plan, the municipality could experience haphazard development, resulting in higher service costs and increased property taxes. In addition, many day to day problems would result from conflicting land uses that could create unacceptable living and working conditions. Yes, the Official Plan affects every City of Kingston resident. The Plan determines where new houses, stores, industries, schools, parks, and other land uses will be built; protects our natural environment; and directs the construction of new services such as sewers, watermains and roads. Sometimes due to new conditions in the community or a proposed development, an Official Plan may need to be changed or 'amended'. An Official Plan amendment is a Bylaw passed by City Council. An amendment may seek to change the land use designation of a property and/or apply new policies to that property as part of a proposed development or expansion to an existing use that is not allowed under the existing Official Plan. An Official Plan amendment may also require other approvals before the development can take place such as a Zoning Bylaw amendment. Although Official Plans must be approved by the Provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, City Council has been granted authority to approve Official Plan amendments. With Official Plan amendments, the applicant must be able to show City Council that the proposed development meets the City's long term plans for the area and is compatible with surrounding land uses. The process for amending an Official Plan is made up of the following 11 steps: You should discuss your plans with City planning staff before you submit the application. A planner will: The planner may also suggest that other city departments such as the engineering department and/or Utilities Kingston be consulted before you submit the application to determine if there are any development issues or concerns. After you have consulted with city staff, you will need to submit the following to the planning department: Applications will not be accepted if incomplete or inaccurate information is provided. Once the application has been received, you will be sent a letter advising you of the planner who will be responsible for your application. The planner will send out a notice to interested parties requesting to receive notification that your application has been received. The application will also be provided to other city departments and outside agencies for review and comment. Once the application review is completed, it will be considered by the planning committee, which is one of the standing committees of City Council. A public meeting report to the planning committee will be prepared by the planner. This report will include a description of the subject lands, a summary of the proposed development and an outline of the regulations and policies that relate to the application such as those in the Official Plan and the Provincial Policy Statement. Once the public meeting report has been prepared, a statutory public meeting at the planning committee needs to be scheduled to consider your application. This public meeting will also consider other development approval requirements for your application, such as Zoning Bylaw amendments, should they be required. A 'Notice of Public Meeting' will be posted on the City's website and published in the Kingston Whig Standard as well as mailed to all property owners within 120 metres of the subject lands and to other interested parties requesting to receive notification at least 20 days before the meeting date. In addition to these notices and depending on the nature of your application, you may also be required to install signage on the subject lands that notifies the public about this meeting. The planning committee typically meets on the first and third Thursday of every month. Public meetings generally start at 6:30 p.m. and are held prior to the regular meeting of the planning committee. At the public meeting, you or someone on your behalf will make a presentation describing your proposed development and the reasons for the Official Plan amendment. At this point any interested party may make written submissions to the planning committee or appear before the committee to comment on your application. Once all public input has been received, you will have an opportunity to respond to the comments. After this, the public meeting will be closed. The planner will collect all of the comments made at the public meeting and prepare a comprehensive report. This report will include an analysis of the proposed development, a discussion of the issues raised at the public meeting and a recommendation on whether your application should be approved or rejected. If the comprehensive report recommends approval of your application, a draft of the proposed Bylaw to amend the Official Plan will also be included. Based on the planner's comprehensive report and the comments made at the public meeting, your application will be considered during a future regular meeting of the planning committee. The planning committee will then prepare its recommendation to City Council to approve your application with or without changes, reject your application or defer its decision until additional information is received. During a City Council meeting, Council may adopt the planning committee's recommendation, amend it, reject it or refer it back to the planning committee for further information. If your application is approved by City Council, the bylaw to adopt the Official Plan amendment will be given three readings at that City Council meeting. After City Council approves an Official Plan amendment, a 'Notice of Adoption' will be sent by the City Clerk within 15 days of Council's decision pursuant to the requirements of the Planning Act. This notice will include information on the Bylaw to adopt the Official Plan amendment and will provide a 20 day period within which an appeal of the Bylaw may be made to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal. Any person with an interest in the matter may appeal the decision of City Council to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal provided that they made a presentation at the public meeting or provided a written submission prior to the decision being made. If no appeals to the bylaw are received, the city clerk will issue a declaration that no appeals were filed and that the Official Plan amendment has come into effect. If the bylaw is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the final decision regarding approval or rejection of your application will be made following a hearing process. After your application has been submitted, it will normally take four to six months to process the application to the stage where a recommendation can be made by City Council. The approval process may be longer for applications that propose major developments, deal with complex supporting information or extensive public input or require additional development approvals such as a Zoning Bylaw Amendment (note that if a Zoning Bylaw Amendment is also required, there may be an opportunity for the City to deal with both the Official Plan Amendment and Zoning Bylaw Amendment applications at the same time). If an application is appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, the hearing process will add time to the approval procedure as well.

The City has 29 snowplows of varying types to clear nearly 1,800 kilometres of lanes of roadway. Here are the road plowing priorities and standards during normal winter conditions: When snow continues to fall over a long period, plows may not be able to immediately clear local residential and less travelled roads as they must continue working to ensure major roads and transit routes are clear. Kingston is one of the few municipalities in Ontario to clear all public sidewalks. The City has 15 sidewalk plows to clear snow from more than 600 kilometres of sidewalk. These plows are not equipped to remove ice from sidewalks. Here are the sidewalk plowing priorities during normal winter conditions: Snowplows clear streets from the centre of the street to the curb \u2013 sometimes leaving snow across private driveways. This cannot be efficiently prevented. Shovel the snow to the right of your driveway to decrease the amount left by the plow. When snowplows move around a bend in the street, the turning motion of the vehicle has a funnel effect on the snow coming off the end of the plow. This results in a build up of snow being unavoidably deposited in driveways beside curves in the road. Greater amounts of snow are also deposited in yards beside street corners. Newer sub divisions have \"mountable\" or dropped curbs, which make it easy for builders to place driveways anywhere on a given lot \u2013 but also make it difficult for snowplow operators to determine the edge of the curb. Night time plowing and heavy weather make assessing the curb even more challenging. If an operator gets in too close to the curb, the plow can damage boulevards and lawns. Operators err on the side of caution. To deal with heavy snowfall, cul de sac clearing is performed in two steps: first, the snowplow will clear the cul de sac to open up the roadway, then, after it has stopped snowing, it will come back to clean up. During the clean up phase, remaining snow is pushed either to the centre of the cul de sac or removed completely, depending room for snow storage. Never let your children play in these snow piles \u2013 it is not safe. When snow continues to fall over a long period, snowplows may have to clear streets more than once. They do a first pass to open up the street and make it passable to traffic, and then go back to cleanup and bring the street to satisfactory condition. Multiple trips on the same street can be expected during large winter storms. When snowfall makes it necessary, the City clears snow overnight to ensure roads are ready for morning rush hour. Snow clearing operations are more efficient at night when there is little road traffic and no cars parked on the streets. When it's snowing we're going! Residents may see City crews out when it's not snowing. Our operators must respond to expected weather as well as current weather. To help ensure safe driving conditions during expected weather, the City pro actively applies treatments to \u2013 or \"pre treats\"\u2013 the roads. Depending on the kind of weather expected, one of two applications is used: Also, please keep in mind that weather varies across the city, so it can be snowing in one neighbourhood, but not in another. Unfortunately, lawn damage does occur sometimes during snow clearing operations. If damage occurs, please contact the City's customer service group at 613 546 0000 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday. City crews are deployed early in the spring to fix damaged areas. The City's sidewalk clearing plows are not equipped to remove ice from sidewalks. Salt does melt the icy surfaces, but sidewalks can ice up again as snowbanks melt onto the sidewalk during the day and freeze up at night. Sand is the preferred treatment as it provides grip for pedestrians using the sidewalk. Canada Post. The City is not responsible for clearing the community Canada Post mailboxes found in the newer subdivisions. These are completely maintained by Canada Post. You can contact Canada Post at 1 800 267 1177. Your snow and ice removal responsibilities include: Businesses in the Kingston DBIA fronting onto public sidewalks are required by bylaw to keep them safe by clearing snow and ice and covering them with salt or sand as often as necessary. All businesses fronting onto public sidewalks are required by bylaw to remove any hazardous rooftop snow and icicles hanging above the sidewalk.

The system then compresses the refrigerant and condenses it from a vapour to a liquid, releasing the heat so that the cooled/liquid refrigerant can be expanded and sent back into the home, where it starts the cycle again. There are two types of central air conditioner systems to choose from: $2,400 to more than $6,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Room air conditioners, also known as, window air conditioners, cool individual rooms rather than your entire home. These air conditioners are less expensive to operate than central air conditioners because they only provide cooling in areas that are needed. They are also a good option for residents in high rise buildings without central air conditioning. $200 to $600 Source: Natural Resources Canada Space and water heating are the biggest users of energy in Canadian homes which accounts for approximately 80per cent of residential energy consumption and 99per cent of GHG emissions in Ontario residences Boilers use gas or oil to provide space heating and hot water to your home. Boilers distribute heat using radiators or in floor radiant heating, eliminating the need for pre existing duct systems. Gas and oil boilers are subject to Canada\u2019s Energy Efficiency Regulations, which sets minimum performance standards for their energy efficiency. All boilers sold in Canada are energy efficient. Check the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) rating, the minimum should be between 82 and 84 per cent. Replacing your oil boiler? Consider switching to a natural gas boiler which tends to produce less waste and fewer harmful emissions. $3,000 to $8,000 Source: Natural Resources Canada If your house, or a room, has moist or wet stains on a wall or ceiling, musty odours, windows or pipes that are covered with condensation, and/or feels stuffy, you may need a dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers regulate the humidity in a room by removing excess moisture from the air, thereby creating a living condition that is inhospitable to dust mites, mould and other allergenic organisms. They run quietly and efficiently in the background without most people even noticing. There are two types of dehumidifiers available, portable and whole house. For significant, year round issues of high humidity, get a whole house dehumidifier that uses your home\u2019s heating and cooling system to reduce the humidity throughout your entire house. If the humidity is periodic or confined to one room, a portable unit is sufficient. Whole house units $1,000 \u2013 $2,000+; portable units $150 \u2013 $300. Source: Natural Resources Canada Heating water accounts for up to 20 per cent of a home\u2019s energy use, making it the second highest energy consumer after space heating. Drain water heat recovery systems capture the heat from water going down a drain, typically the shower, and use it to heat cold water entering your water heater. It\u2019s particularly effective when there are simultaneous water flows i.e. when you\u2019re using hot water in the shower at the same time that water is flowing down the drain. $550 \u2013 $1,700 plus installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada A furnace uses ductwork and vents to distribute warm air throughout your house. High efficiency gas furnaces are quiet, reliable, and effective at maintaining a comfortable home, and they can reduce your energy bill by up to 45 per cent. An ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified forced air furnace, fueled by gas uses 6 per cent less energy, fueled by oil uses 9 per cent less energy, on average than a standard model. Space heating represents more than half of your home\u2019s energy use and offers the most potential for reducing your energy bill. If your furnace was installed before 1990, it\u2019s probably a lower efficiency model, as regulations for furnaces in Canada have been updated since then. If you upgrade to an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified furnace, you will save money and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases you emit. $2,000 \u2013 $8,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Space heating accounts for 60per cent of the energy used in the average Canadian home. For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Home Space heating accounts for about 60 per cent of the energy used in the average Canadian home. A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air. Choose an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ductless heating and cooling system to cut your electrical heating bill by up to 60 per cent, and your cooling bill by 30 per cent, depending on your climate. $2,500 to $5,000+ per unit, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Space heating accounts for about 60 per cent of the energy used in the average Canadian home. If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures. Ground source heating produce less CO2 than other forms of space heating systems. $20,000 \u2013 $40,000, including installation. Source: Natural Resources Canada Homes built after 1977 are typically more airtight, which helps to prevent heat loss but also prevents air circulation, which is important for your health and comfort. Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems. Source: Natural Resources Canada Heating water accounts for approximately 20per cent of your home\u2019s energy bill. Water heaters with storage tanks are the most common in Canadian homes, but they are not the most energy efficient. Electricity, gas or oil is used to heat water stored in the tank and supply it, as needed, to household fixtures and appliances. Storage tanks typically hold between 113 and 378 litres of water in their tanks, and this water is continuously reheated and kept hot 24 hours a day. $800 to $1,500, plus installation.

Tankless water heaters heat water as it flows, and only when required, using an electric element or gas burner. They provide endless hot water and the heat on demand feature means you only pay to heat water as you use it, instead of paying to keep a tank of water heated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. $1,000 to $2,800 Source: Natural Resources Canada", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/-/community-invited-to-attend-a-workshop-for-the-central-kingston-growth-strategy": "Community invited to attend a workshop for the Central Kingston Growth Strategy July 11, 2019  The City is inviting residents to attend one of two consultant led workshops on the Central Kingston Growth Strategy (CKGS).

There are two types of central air conditioner systems to choose from: $2,400 to more than $6,000. Source: Natural Resources Canada Room air conditioners, also known as, window air conditioners, cool individual rooms rather than your entire home. These air conditioners are less expensive to operate than central air conditioners because they only provide cooling in areas that are needed. They are also a good option for residents in high rise buildings without central air conditioning. $200 to $600 Source: Natural Resources Canada Space and water heating are the biggest users of energy in Canadian homes which accounts for approximately 80per cent of residential energy consumption and 99per cent of GHG emissions in Ontario residences Boilers use gas or oil to provide space heating and hot water to your home. Boilers distribute heat using radiators or in floor radiant heating, eliminating the need for pre existing duct systems. Gas and oil boilers are subject to Canada\u2019s Energy Efficiency Regulations, which sets minimum performance standards for their energy efficiency. All boilers sold in Canada are energy efficient. Check the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) rating, the minimum should be between 82 and 84 per cent. Replacing your oil boiler? Consider switching to a natural gas boiler which tends to produce less waste and fewer harmful emissions. $3,000 to $8,000 Source: Natural Resources Canada If your house, or a room, has moist or wet stains on a wall or ceiling, musty odours, windows or pipes that are covered with condensation, and/or feels stuffy, you may need a dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers regulate the humidity in a room by removing excess moisture from the air, thereby creating a living condition that is inhospitable to dust mites, mould and other allergenic organisms. They run quietly and efficiently in the background without most people even noticing. There are two types of dehumidifiers available, portable and whole house. For significant, year round issues of high humidity, get a whole house dehumidifier that uses your home\u2019s heating and cooling system to reduce the humidity throughout your entire house. If the humidity is periodic or confined to one room, a portable unit is sufficient. Whole house units $1,000 \u2013 $2,000+; portable units $150 \u2013 $300.

Drain water heat recovery systems capture the heat from water going down a drain, typically the shower, and use it to heat cold water entering your water heater. It\u2019s particularly effective when there are simultaneous water flows i.e. when you\u2019re using hot water in the shower at the same time that water is flowing down the drain. $550 \u2013 $1,700 plus installation.

High efficiency gas furnaces are quiet, reliable, and effective at maintaining a comfortable home, and they can reduce your energy bill by up to 45 per cent. An ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified forced air furnace, fueled by gas uses 6 per cent less energy, fueled by oil uses 9 per cent less energy, on average than a standard model. Space heating represents more than half of your home\u2019s energy use and offers the most potential for reducing your energy bill. If your furnace was installed before 1990, it\u2019s probably a lower efficiency model, as regulations for furnaces in Canada have been updated since then. If you upgrade to an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified furnace, you will save money and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases you emit. $2,000 \u2013 $8,000.

For electrically heated homes, you may be able to reduce your heating costs by up to 50per cent if you install an all electric air source heat pump. An air source heat pump is an electrical device that uses the difference between outdoor air temperatures and indoor air temperatures to cool and heat your home. Acting as a high efficiency air conditioner in the summer, and a heater in the winter, an air source heat pump uses a refrigerant that responds to temperature. In summer, a heat pump will move heat out of your home and release it outdoors. In fall, it brings heat into your home from outside, even when it\u2019s chilly (0\u00b0C). Many homes can rely on these products to heat or cool their homes year round. $2,500 to more than $5,000 per unit, including installation.

A ductless mini split system is an energy efficient heating and cooling system that doesn\u2019t require ductwork, making them ideal for older electrically heated homes and/or homes with no ductwork. Also known as ductless heat pumps, they take advantage of the difference in temperature between outdoor and indoor air to heat or cool a room. The temperature can be adjusted through a wall mounted console, remote control or smartphone app. Ductless units require only a very small hole to be drilled into an exterior wall, making them less vulnerable to air leakage and security problems. Mini splits also avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork, which can account for more than 30 per cent of the energy used to heat or cool indoor air. Choose an ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ductless heating and cooling system to cut your electrical heating bill by up to 60 per cent, and your cooling bill by 30 per cent, depending on your climate. $2,500 to $5,000+ per unit, including installation.

If your home is electrically heated, you can reduce your heating costs by up to 50 per cent by installing an electric ground source heat pump. Ground source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth, groundwater or both to heat your home in the winter and cool it in the summer, and supply hot water. Ground source heat pumps are more effective at heating homes during Canadian winters and provide greater energy savings than air source heat pumps because in the winter underground temperatures are higher than air temperatures. Ground source heating produce less CO2 than other forms of space heating systems. $20,000 \u2013 $40,000, including installation.

Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), also know as fresh air exchangers, remove excess moisture and indoor pollutants (mould, household chemicals and bacteria) and let fresh air inside while minimizing heat loss. During the fall and winter, an HRV captures heat from air leaving your house and uses it to heat the fresh air coming into your house. Similarly, an HRV can reverse this process during the spring and summer, removing some heat from the incoming air and transferring it to the outgoing air. $350 to $500 for mounted, room sized models; $500 to $1,500 for whole house systems.

Water heaters with storage tanks are the most common in Canadian homes, but they are not the most energy efficient. Electricity, gas or oil is used to heat water stored in the tank and supply it, as needed, to household fixtures and appliances. Storage tanks typically hold between 113 and 378 litres of water in their tanks, and this water is continuously reheated and kept hot 24 hours a day. $800 to $1,500, plus installation.

These plans allow municipalities to create financial or other types of tools, or direct capital investments \u2013 such as tax increment based grants \u2013 towards achieving community goals. Brownfields are abandoned, idle, or unused industrial and commercial lands that have been or are perceived to have environmental contamination due to historic activities. A brownfield site may be as small as a vacant gas station with remaining underground storage tanks, or as large as several hundred acres of abandoned factory that may have dumped waste on its property during its operation Tax increment based grants are tools to attract private sector investment and stimulate development in targeted areas of the City. They are based on the difference between the municipal portion of the property taxes collected on a property before development and the estimated taxes that will be collected after development. They are reconfirmed against actual taxes before any grant monies are paid. Following is an example of how the difference, which amounts to the tax increment based grant, is calculated. Property taxes after development $ 40,000/yr x 85% (Municipal Portion) => $ 35,000/yr Property taxes before development $ 5,000/yr x 85% (Municipal Portion) => $ 4,250/yr Tax increment $ 29,750/yr Incentive 80% of Increment x 80% Tax increment based grant (80%) $ 23,800/yr Total Maximum Grant Available $23,800/yr x 10 years = $238,000 They help to achieve Kingston's community improvement goals of reducing the number of contaminated sites in the City and renewing Kingston's downtown. They also contribute to the growth of the City's assessment base by attracting private sector projects. Every $1 spent on invested in brownfield redevelopment, $3.80 is invested in the economy. Contact the Brownfield Project Manager to arrange for a Pre Consultation to review your project. No. Applying for grants is a separate process from seeking Council Planning approval for projects. All projects, regardless of whether they are eligible for a grant, must go through the City's planning and development approvals process and seek Council approval where required. The funding is through the property tax rebates and cancellations by both City and Province. If a property is vacant and contaminated, the tax base is very low, however when remediated and redeveloped, the tax base increases substantially and the province and the municipality want to assist in the process by rebating the property taxes for a period of time to compensate for the extra costs of remediation and rehabilitation, compared to working with clean land. The difference between tax assistance under BFTIP and a TIRGP is that taxes are cancelled or deferred on the tax rolls for BFTIP. TIRGP and similar programs are arrangements where an amount equivalent to taxes is granted back to a property owner or other eligible recipient. There is no provision in the provincial tax assistance program for grants, as the program does not provide for direct payments, only for a cancellation or deferral of municipal and education taxes. Some of the eligible costs are: For the TIRGP, the grant is paid annually in an amount equal to 80% of the incremental increase in municipal taxes of the property (pre development versus post development). The grant is payable for up to 10 years or once the eligible costs have been repaid to the owner, whichever comes first. A tax sale is the sale of a property by a municipality to recoup unpaid property taxes. When the property tax on the land goes into arrears for a period of three years, the City can initiate a sale of the property to recover the amount of unpaid taxes. Occasionally, however, a property may fail to sell at a municipal tax sale. This would occur when the City does not receive any bids on the property that meet or exceed its cancellation price (total unpaid taxes plus the cost of undertaking the sale). A property with questionable market value, such as a brownfield, may be more likely to fail a tax sale process. A Crown lien on the property may also contribute to the failure of a tax sale as this is one the few liens that is not removed from a tax sale. The City does not automatically own failed tax sale properties, however during a 2 year period (the Failed Tax Sale period), the city has the choice and ability to transfer the properties and complete environmental assessments on the property. This can productive step if contaminated properties are not purchased. The properties can be transferred to a developer who will remediate the property and redevelop it to a productive state. The Failed Tax Sale properties are transferred using a competitive RFP (Request for Proposal) process.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/-/offer-input-on-two-kingston-waterfront-projects": "Offer input on two Kingston waterfront projects October 10, 2017  The City of Kingston is seeking input on two Kingston waterfront projects at an upcoming introductory open house.

The building was conceived in a spirit of contextuality while free from the pitfalls of being locked into stylistic constraints.

Controlled pedestrian crossings are locations where motorists and cyclists are required to yield the right of way to pedestrians. They involve a combination of signage, pavement markings, and in some cases, signals or flashing beacons. Visit Get Involved Kingston to see the engagement for Pedestrian Crossing locations. See a map of existing pedestrian crossings. Pedestrian crossovers, also known as PXOs, are marked crosswalks where vehicles must yield to pedestrians crossing the road. They are identified by specific signs and pavement markings. Pedestrians: Motorists: Cyclists: The Pedestrian crossover (PXO) Type B includes overhead and side mounted signs, pavement markings, and a rapid rectangular flashing beacon (RRFB) and push buttons that can be activated by pedestrians. Examples of this type of PXO in Kingston include the crosswalk on Rideau Street in front of Rideaucrest Home and at King Street in front of Kingston General Hospital. The PXO Type C includes side mounted signs, pavement markings, and a rapid rectangular flashing beacon (RRFB) and push buttons that can be activated by pedestrians. The PXO Type D includes side mounted signs and pavement markings, including a ladder crosswalk and a 'yield to pedestrians' marking for motorists. An intersection pedestrian signal (IPS), also known as a \"half signal\", provides a legal crossing for pedestrians across a major roadway. An IPS consists of traffic signal heads for vehicles on the major street only along with signalized pedestrian fixtures and crosswalks. Vehicles approaching the intersection from the side street are controlled by a stop sign. These signals have been installed at a number of locations in Kingston including on King Street at the Tett Centre, King Street at Beverly Street and on Bath Road in front of Frontenac Secondary School. Pedestrians: Motorists and Cyclists: Pedestrians must push a button to activate the walk indicator, which is followed by the flashing hand display. Vehicles on the major roadway must obey the IPS signal and vehicles on the side street must obey the stop sign. After coming to a complete stop, motorists may turn onto the major roadway when it is clear and safe to do so. Vehicles must yield the right of way to pedestrians crossing the main or side streets and to vehicles travelling along the major street. A mid block pedestrian signal (MPS) consists of traffic signal heads for vehicles on the major street along with signalized pedestrian fixtures and crosswalks. Since MPS are installed between intersections, there is no side street traffic. As with an IPS, pedestrians must push a button to activate the walk indication and vehicles on the roadway are subject to the same regulations as at any full traffic signal. Sidewalks are paved paths (concrete or asphalt), generally installed adjacent to roadways, that allow pedestrians to walk in a dedicated area. Off road trails are separated spaces typically through a natural area or corridor that accommodates pedestrians and cyclists. The surface type can range from natural surface to asphalt depending on the location. Both portions of the Waterfront Trail and the K&P Trail are examples of off road trails. In boulevard trails are a separated space found within the boulevard of the roadway \u2013 in place of a sidewalk, which accommodate both pedestrians and cyclists in a shared space. In boulevard trails can be either uni or bi directional. The Bath Road Bikeway is an example of an in boulevard trail in Kingston. Pedestrian priority crossings give priority to the crossing needs of people on foot (and those using mobility devices). They are often called scramble crossings because of the way they allow pedestrians to scramble across the intersection in any direction on the all directions walk signal. The scramble signal at Union and University will operate 24/7 and will stop vehicular traffic in all directions during the scramble phase. In order to further improve pedestrian safety, vehicles will not be permitted to make a right turn on a red light at any time at this intersection. Pedestrians When the walk signal is displayed in all directions, pedestrians can cross to any corner \u2013 even diagonally. This is indicated by the diagonal crosswalk markings and all directions walk signals at the corners of Union Street and University Avenue. Pedestrians may still cross in the direction of traffic when vehicles have a green light and motorists making a left turn or right turn must still yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk as usual. Cyclists Cyclists must dismount and walk their bicycles if they want to cross on the pedestrian priority/scramble signal. Cyclists who do not dismount their bicycles are legally considered vehicles and must obey vehicular traffic signals, including the right turn on red ban. Motorists Motorists are not permitted to proceed in any direction during the scramble crossing \u2013 when the all direction walk signal and all direction red traffic signals are displayed. Motorists should expect increased delays at the intersection since the red lights will be longer in order to accommodate the pedestrian priority/scramble crossing. When the green light is displayed, motorists can proceed as usual and travel straight through the intersection or turn left or right when safe to do so.

To be considered a legal Second Residential Unit, the dwelling must meet applicable zoning and Building Code regulations in order to provide healthy and safe living conditions while integrating appropriately within the neighbourhood. Second Residential Units are an affordable housing option that meets the needs of many households including seniors, extended families, smaller households and singles, people on low incomes, and in house caregiver living arrangements. In addition, Second Residential Units can assist homeowners that need the additional rental income to enter or stay in the housing ownership market. From a neighbourhood sustainability perspective, Second Residential Units help to repopulate neighbourhoods where declining household sizes have reduced overall populations in locations where existing services and infrastructure capacity remains available. Second residential units are permitted within the City as identified within the applicable zoning by law. Please refer to the Second Residential Unit Area mapping here. Second residential units are not permitted: An application for removal of a holding symbol is required for the establishment of a second residential unit in areas identified as \u2018Water Supply/Water Quantity\u2019 and \u2018Servicing Capacity (Cana Subdivision)\u2019. A Second Residential Unit can have a gross floor area that is equal to or less than the gross floor area of the principal dwelling. In accordance with the zoning bylaw, gross floor area means the total area of each floor, above or below grade, including finished attic spaces, measured between the outside of the exterior walls or between the outside of exterior walls and the centre line of party walls dividing the building from another building, but excluding: Yes. All Second Residential Units are required to have a separate entry either from a common entrance vestibule within the principal dwelling or directly from the exterior of the building. Safe entrance and exit must be provided in accordance with the requirements of the Building Code.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Yes. A Second Residential Unit requires a minimum of one parking space that can be provided in a tandem (one vehicle behind the other) arrangement.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Given that the City's historical land use planning framework did not typically include permissions for Second Residential Units, unless you have received previous zoning approval or the second unit has existed for a significant period of time, it is likely your unit is not legal. If you are planning to continue occupation of your second unit you must ensure the unit meets appropriate Building Code and zoning requirements. Be aware that renovations may be required to bring the dwelling up to zoning and Building Code compliance. An inspection conducted by a Building Inspector will determine any existing deficiencies and any required renovations to meet the requirements. Owners of illegal Second Residential Units who do not act in good faith to legalize their unit may be required to remove the unit and/or be subject to a fine. To determine if your lot can accommodate a second residential unit, an individual analysis may need to be completed. A site specific zoning by law amendment may be required. An application for removal of a holding symbol is required for the establishment of a second residential unit in areas identified as \u2018Water Supply/Water Quantity\u2019 and \u2018Servicing Capacity (Cana Subdivision)\u2019. Yes. To assist emergency services, home delivery, and mail services the City will assign a new unit number through the building permitting and zoning review process to recognize your Second Residential Unit.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Owners of Second Residential Units are subject to the responsibilities outlined within the Residential Tenancies Act. Other property related requirements beyond the Building Code and zoning provisions, that all property owners must adhere to, include the City's Property Standards Bylaw which sets out standards for the reasonable upkeep and maintenance of buildings and properties including responsibilities such as yard maintenance and snow removal.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Yes. An untagged bag of garbage will be collected at the curbside from a legally created Second Residential Unit.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/business/planning-and-development/blog/-/blogs/kingston-s-downtown-is-not-static-it-is-evolving-?_com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cityofkingston.ca%2Fbusiness%2Fplanning-and-development%2Fblog%3Fp_p_id%3Dcom_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26_com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet_cur%3D1%26_com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet_delta%3D5": "After six and a half years of planning applications and appeal processes, we have finality on the two towers proposed by Homestead in the North Block along Queen Street \u2013 they are approved with no further appeal processes standing in the way. The Divisional Court just released their final decision on an appeal request from the Frontenac Heritage Foundation \u2013 the Divisional Court decision refuses the request and upholds the November 2021 decision from the Ontario Land Tribunal (the OLT or the Tribunal) approving the two towers. The decision allows a new 19 storey building on Block 3 (51 57 Queen Street) and a 23 storey building on Block 5 (18 Queen Street and 282 Ontario Street). Collectively, the two towers will introduce approximately 400 new residential units, new commercial/museum space and new office space to a key area in our downtown that is targeted by our Official Plan for growth and intensification. I previously wrote about these applications in a series of blog posts covering the original Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (now the OLT) decision (Understanding the August 9 North Block LPAT ruling on August 18, 2019), the decision ordering a new hearing (Outcome of the Section 35 Review for the North Block: LPAT orders a new hearing on January 10, 2020) and the final decision from the OLT (To Get Better Planning Decisions, We Need to Get the Facts Right on November 9, 2021). The Divisional Court decision summarizes the lengthy application background and confirms that the Tribunal\u2019s decision \u201cframed its consideration of the proposed redevelopment in terms of the need to balance heritage and intensification\u201d. It acknowledges that the City \u201chas designated certain areas in the downtown core as Heritage Conservation Districts or Heritage Character Areas. The City has targeted other areas in the same downtown core for growth and intensification, to respond to housing and employment needs, and to contribute to a vital and robust community.\u201d It also reiterates an important element of the evidence that was presented at the OLT, stating \u201cAccording to unchallenged expert evidence submitted to the Tribunal, the economic conditions in Kingston's downtown are fragile and Homestead's proposed development is an important component in the City's plans for its economic recovery.\u201d These two towers will help to ensure the economic heart of our City, our downtown, will remain economically viable by adding more housing, commercial, cultural and office spaces. Why is the economic recovery of the downtown vital to the City overall and why should every resident of Kingston care about this? This YouTube video is a must watch \u2013 it explains this idea better than I ever could in a blog post. In June of 2021, we provided Council with the Lifecycle Fiscal Impacts of Development report, which looked that this exact idea in Kingston \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 the statements in the YouTube video are spot on for Kingston too. This decision supports the professional opinions provided by City staff, both to Council and to the Ontario Land Tribunal, and confirms that our downtown can evolve with large scale intensification projects in the right locations without impacting the important cultural heritage resources we value as a City. The Divisional Court decision, when speaking to the previous Capitol Theatre redevelopment decision (IN8 and Burfoot), clarifies that the future vision for the North Block is different than that specific area of the Princess Street by stating: \u201cLastly, Frontenac contends that the Tribunal should have rejected the proposed development because, in IN8 and Burfoot, it held that proposals to build high rise towers in downtown Kingston were incompatible with the Official Plan's objective of preserving Kingston's unique heritage character. There is no general prohibition, either in the Official Plan or in the Tribunal's previous decisions, on the construction of high rises in downtown Kingston.\u201d These buildings represent a positive evolution for planning in Kingston. The two towers will redevelop two contaminated properties and revitalize this area by bringing a significant number of new housing units close to diverse commercial, employment and recreation options. They will help to achieve our climate action and sustainability goals by bringing more population to an area that does not rely on cars to get to places we work, live and play. They will introduce new museum space, commercial opportunities and office spaces that will help to further the vitality and the long term economy of our downtown and City overall. The buildings are well designed and will make this stretch of Queen Street more comfortable for pedestrians with human scaled architecture along the street. They will bring exciting new commercial and pedestrian activity to an area that is currently covered by uninviting parking lots. Perhaps most importantly, the approval of these towers confirms that the vision and intentions of the City\u2019s Official Plan is for heritage and intensification to work harmoniously. Some people may never agree with the Official Plan on this point, but in downtown Kingston, the two rely on each other and are both vital for the long term success of our community.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/explore/culture-history/culture-blog/-/blogs/the-power-of-public-art-today-and-always?_com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cityofkingston.ca%2Fexplore%2Fculture-history%2Fculture-blog%3Fp_p_id%3Dcom_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26_com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet_cur%3D1%26_com_liferay_blogs_web_portlet_BlogsPortlet_delta%3D5": "The COVID 19 pandemic has changed our lives significantly over the past year and a a half but there is relief in sight as people get vaccinated and as things open up again as part of Ontario\u2019s Roadmap to Reopen. How we consume the arts and culture is one of the things that has changed the most as we binge watch television, stream movies, listen to Spotify playlists and seek out content online and through social media. Those experiences fill a need but they\u2019re definitely not the same as coming together in person at the movies, concerts, museums or galleries. Something that hasn\u2019t change is our ability to get outside, which means public art has really come into its own as a result of COVID 19. Public art\u2014whether it be murals, sculptures, installations or performance\u2014offers the opportunity for people to participate in the arts safely, while adhering to public health guidelines like physical distancing. It\u2019s the same all over the world as people have found ways to connect with art and with each other doing simple things like going for walks, exploring their neighbourhoods and interacting with what they discover along the way. Public art is unique in that it brings art, artists and audiences together within parks, public squares and other shared spaces. The experience of public art can also help us think differently about our world and, during COVID 19, it has become a way to explore big issues and to provide artists with paid work as other things have shut down.

Horse and Cart by Nicholas Crombach, Victoria Park, 2021. Photo supplied by artist. The first public artwork to be unveiled in 2021 is a sculpture called \u201cHorse and Cart\u201d by Kingston based artist, Nicholas Crombach. This playful work references an old fashioned children\u2019s tricycle from the horse and buggy era when Victoria Park was established. Victoria Park was identified as a site for public art as it was undergoing renewal and redevelopment and the sculpture\u2014which measures 15 ft in length and 7.5 ft in height\u2014aims to bring local history to life and to engage the imagination of park users. You can also watch a timelapse video of the sculpture being installed produced by the artist here.

The third and final permanent public artwork to be unveiled this year is part of The Hub Project that has been evolving at the intersection of Princess and Division Streets and connecting the adjacent neighbourhoods in new and creative ways. The artist selected to create this permanent public artwork is contemporary Canadian artist Brandon Vickerd who was selected by a jury for his proposal, \u201cThe Wilds of Kingston\u201d, that consists of two bronze figures that appear to be people leisurely going about their day; however, upon closer inspection, the figures reveal themselves to be extraordinary characters with the heads of a pigeon and a squirrel.

Client: Frontenac Standard Condominium Corporation The challenge in this project was to bring a large scale building mass into a settled and well established streetscape and block structure of low rise historical buildings. Much of the detailing and material choice were introduced to mitigate and enhance the change in scale, and to break the building mass down into simple pieces. The building was conceived in a spirit of contextuality while free from the pitfalls of being locked into stylistic constraints. Kingston\u2019s approach to focus on material and massing compatibility has allowed this building to reach a design potential that would not be possible in a more stylistically strict approval process.Post By: Web AdminPost Date: 2017 11 27Shot By: Shot Location: 121 Queen Street Designer: Colbourne and Kembel, Architects Inc.

Jason is the third person to hold this position, having been preceded by Eric Folsom and Helen Humphreys, and it is a role he will continue to fill for four years as a spokesperson for the literary arts in the community. Of course, Kingston is already well known as a literary city thanks to the number of writers who call this city their home and thanks to the existence of literary festivals such as Kingston WritersFest, and an endless number of community led poetry and literary events and readings. Celebrating Kingston\u2019s rich literary identity was part of the inspiration for Jason\u2019s first new poem as Poet Laureate, titled \u201cI Woke Up in My City\u201d that he read at the Mayor\u2019s Levee on January 1, 2019. We\u2019re thrilled to also share his newest poem that was shared yesterday at the 2020 Mayor\u2019s Levee event titled \u201cNew Year\u201d. In addition to writing new poems, an important component of the Poet Laureate position is to attend both community and City led events to promote literature and to enhance the profile of the literary arts within the City and beyond. Jason has taken up the charge with enthusiasm and the following list of activities provides a snapshot of what he has accomplished this past year.

Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A backwater valve, also called a backflow valve, is a device used to prevent outbound water in a home\u2019s drain pipes from re entering, or \u201cbackflowing\u201d\u2014into your home. The valve has a flap that allows water to leave but closes to prevent water and/or sewage from entering. Backwater valves are designed to close the sewer line during periods of extreme rain to prevent water from entering your home. When the valve is closed you should not use any plumbing fixtures (i.e. toilets, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines) because water will not drain and will back up into your home. The Insurance Bureau of Canada recommends residents not install the plug type valves, as they allow sewer backup pressure to build beneath your basement floor, which may cause structural damage to your home. $500 to $2,000 including installation. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. Early detection of water leakage can help you quickly determine the cause and source of the leak and address it before flooding occurs. Flood alarms, also known as, flood detectors, water alarms or water detectors are electronic devices that detect the presence of water and set off an alarm when its sensors are triggered. Flood alarms come in different shapes and sizes and with a wide range of features. New models have WiFi capabilities with smart home integration. $25 to $150 Cool roofs reflect the sun\u2019s rays and reduce heat build up through a light coloured or highly reflective roofing product such as a coating, new membrane or shingle. Most roofs in Canada are dark in colour and absorb heat from the sun\u2019s rays transferring it into the rooms below. Because cool roofs are better at reflecting the sun\u2019s energy, less heat is transferred inside your home. As a result, you may not have to use your air conditioner as much, saving you energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cool roofs also increase the life expectancy of your roof, because they reflect the heat and UV rays that damage and age roof materials. Dark coloured roofs in high density areas also contribute to the urban heat island effect \u2013 significantly warmer temperatures in urban areas compared to rural areas. As a result of climate change, Kingston is expected to see dramatic increases in the number of extremely hot days due to continued global warming. Installing a cool roof is one way to help to offset this. There are cool roof options for all types of roofs, including steep slope (pitched roofs), low slope (flat roofs).. Roofing products are tested for their reflectivity and given a Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value between 0 100. The higher the number, the more reflective it is. If you want to convert an existing roof into a cool roof, you have the following options: Green roofs are living roofs. They support the growth of vegetation and consist of a waterproofing membrane, drainage layer, organic growing medium (soil), and vegetation. Green roofs capture stormwater, improve air quality and create habitats for pollinators, birds and other wildlife. Green roofs also help insulate your home in the summer and help reduce the overall temperature in Kingston. Green roof systems are generally classified as extensive, semi intensive or intensive. Your budget, vision and the structural capacity of your building will determine which type of green roof you select. Every home with a basement is at risk of flooding, even if it has not happened before. Water in your basement is most likely to occur during a heavy rainfall, or when snow and ice is melting, but you can take steps to help reduce or prevent it from happening. A sump pump is a small pump that is installed at the lowest part of your basement or crawlspace that prevents flooding. The sump is the low space that collects liquids, while the sump pump detects water in the sump and moves it away from your home through a network of pipes that is dug into the floor of the basement. Groundwater can easily rise through the cracks in your foundation during long periods of rain. If there is a possibility that flooding can occur in your basement or crawl space, a sump pump will collect all of this water and redirect it away from your home. There are two types of primary sump pumps available: submersible and pedestal pumps. Submersible pumps have the motor placed underwater in your sump basin, while pedestal pumps are positioned with the pump motor out of the water, above your sump basin. It is recommended that Kingston residents consider a submersible sump pump as they are the quietest, most powerful and effective sump pump. They also allow for an airtight lid that will stop debris from falling into the pit and prevent moisture and odorous air from being released into your home. $700 to $5,000, including installation.

All of us have been impacted, but the cultural sector remains among the hardest hit and is anticipated to be among the slowest to recover. The Canadian Association for the Performing Arts has been providing a snapshot of what has been happening and the data is staggering: 36.0% businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector reported that their revenues from 2020 were down 50% or more compared to 2019. This is a greater percentage than any other industries, including accommodation and food services (32.7%), and nearly three times more than the national average (12.9%). Employment in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector In Canada is now 37.8% lower than last year at the same period. Arts and culture workers anticipate an 18 month recovery period and as many as one in three (35%) are uncertain about their future in the arts. In September 2020, the Ontario Museums Association published Exhibiting Resiliency that reported on the impacts of COVID 19 on the sector to date and that also provided a roadmap for the survival, recovery and long term sustainability of museums in Ontario. That report cited 20% of museums, and 40% of seasonal museums, were unable to reopen in 2020 and lost an estimated $120 million in revenue. It also estimated that only 18% of museums were confident they would have the financial resources needed to operate in 2021. The impact the pandemic has had on artists and arts and heritage organizations is significant and it is anticipated the uncertainty will continue for a long time yet. That is why all levels of government have made significant efforts to support the short term viability of the cultural sector as well as its long term recovery and sustainability. The City\u2019s Cultural Services Department functions as the municipal cultural development agency that supports cultural vitality in and across the community. Like others, our regular programs, services, and strategic initiatives have been impacted and have had to shift and adapt to support the sustainability and vibrancy of the sector. Prior to the pandemic, 90% of Ontario residents agreed that an active local arts scene helps make a community a better place to live and 88% of Ontario residents believed that if their community lost its arts activities, people living there would lose something of value (https://www.arts.on.ca/research impact/impact of the arts in ontario). I am not sure any of us could have imagined a future in which the arts would be lost so its more important then ever we support local artists and arts activities while also making sure we adhere to all the necessary government and public health guidelines that exist. In this moment, the City of Kingston continues to support the arts, heritage and culture locally through a combination of programs, projects, funding initiatives and strategies. Kingston residents are still able to access cultural programming online through various websites and the Cultural Services Department also continues to support local artists through a combination of initiatives that support the visual and performing arts. Museums from Home: The PumpHouse and MacLachlan Woodworking Museum offer downloadable PDF Activity Pages to keep your family engaged with STEAM education. Virtual education programs for educators and classes: Downloadable PDF forms highlighting content from popular on site programs are available for free. Virtual Grand OnStage: The popular Grand OnStage program relaunched in October 2020 as a virtual series featuring customized online experiences and opportunities for artist engagement with exceptional talent form across Canada. Public Art: Kingston artists are being commissioned as part of multiple temporary public art projects and the City continues to deliver its Public Art Program to enhance the public realm and add value to the community. Poet Laureate: Poet Laureate, Jason Heroux continues to mentor local writers and launched \u2018Poetry in the Time of Pandemic\u2019 that featured original poems created by Kingston poets to mark this moment in time and provide a message of endurance and hope. YGK Music: Local musicians are being promoted and paid through the creation of 2021 online playlists, aimed at profiling the talent of Kingston\u2019s music scene. The Love Kingston Marketplace is scheduled to return in 2021 and will provide opportunities to enjoy small scale live performances by local musicians in Springer Market Square. This joint initiative between the City of Kingston, Tourism Kingston and the Downtown Kingston! BIA reimagines parts of downtown Kingston to help respond to the impacts of COVID 19 on residents, businesses, culture, tourism and the local economy and includes opportunities to support local artists with paid work. Kingston City Council has continued to invest in the arts and heritage throughout the pandemic and has even invested an additional $200,000 in 2021 to support local artists and not for profit arts organizations. City of Kingston Arts Fund: This program continues to provide critical Operating and Project grants to arts organizations and collectives and has also expanded in 2021 to include special on time funding in the form of Resiliency Grants and Adapt Grant programs. City of Kingston Heritage Fund: This program remains in place and provides annual Operating and Project grants. In 2021, the overall funding envelope has been reduced by 5% but an additional $64,181.40 is also available because of unallocated funds in 2020. Artist entrepreneurs and creative businesses are also encouraged to check out other the other City funded pandemic relief grants currently available as they may be eligible to receive funding through these other initiatives. On April 6, Kingston City Council approved the City\u2019s first ever creative industries strategy. This was identified as a strategic priority of Council and is linked to the recently approved Integrated Economic Development Strategy being led by the Kingston Economic Development Corporation. It has been identified that Kingston is well positioned to pursue this work given its access to 14.4 million people in the Toronto Ottawa Montreal corridor and the development of a Creative Industry Strategy is intended to support the long term success of film, music and theatre initially, making Kingston a destination of choice for a wide range of creative industries, producers and consumers. The City also continues to work with partner organizations to support the cultural and creative sectors and more information can be found by visiting their websites. Other artists, organizations and groups are equally working hard to support the people, groups and organizations that make up the local cultural sector. We have a long way to go yet but Kingston has long been enriched by having one of the most active and vital cultural scenes for a community of its size and there is no reason to believe it will not continue to be vibrant through our shared support once we move past the worst of the pandemic.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/committees-boards/committee-of-adjustment": "The Committee of Adjustment is composed of seven members, who are appointed by the Council of the City of Kingston and is guided by the provisions of the Official Plan, including Bylaw 2010 205 (the Committee Bylaw).

Kingston is a destination of choice for a wide range of Creative Industries, producers, and consumers. In April 2021, Kingston City Council approved a Creative Industries Strategy that outlines a framework and recommendations to support and expand the creative industries sector and enhance economic development opportunities. This is an initiative identified in City Council\u2019s Strategic Priorities (2019 2022) and the Strategy lays the foundation for investment, tactics and targeted activities that will create a sustainable and thriving ecosystem to support business growth, start ups, investment attraction and opportunities in the community. Key partners in implementing the Creative Industries Strategy are the City of Kingston\u2019s Arts & Culture Services Department and the Office of Strategy, Innovation & Partnerships, Kingston Economic Development Corporation, and Tourism Kingston. Additional partners include the Kingston Film Office, the Kingston Theatre Alliance, St. Lawrence College, and Queen\u2019s University. The Creative Industries Strategy recommendations are also embedded in the Integrated Economic Development Strategy jointly led by the Kingston Economic Development Corporation and the City of Kingston. Critical to the success of the Creative Industries Strategy is the ability to leverage Kingston\u2019s value propositions that include: Three areas of focus for potential growth in Kingston for Creatives Industries were identified. These areas of focus \u2013 Film, Music and Theatre \u2013 will emerge as key subsectors for Kingston during the next 5 10 years. The Strategy also recognizes the strength of literary arts and visual arts in Kingston, as well as heritage and Indigenous heritage and culture that provides a competitive advantage as well as a unique foundation upon which creative industries can grow. The Strategy Framework for the Creative Industries includes two pillars, six themes, five enablers, and 15 recommended initiatives. Staff will report back to Council through the Arts, Recreation & Community Policies Committee in Q1 2022 with a progress update regarding the status of the implementation plan and the work completed to date.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/explore/culture-history/arts/grand-onstage": "The Grand OnStage (GO) 2022 23 season has exciting milestone news to share.

City staff works every day to ensure that economic development and growth opportunities are available to everyone interested \u2013 and to help support current and future business owners get set up for success. The planning, building & licensing department works to help guide businesses through our system, which has been designed to help them thrive. In order to protect the public and ensure development meets the long term growth objectives of the City, we have a number of processes that work together to ensure that businesses are located in areas appropriate for the type of businesses activities they are undertaking and are licensed to ensure they have been reviewed by all necessary departments from a health and safety perspective. Our three departments work together to facilitate this process. 1. Planning manages development in a manner that meets the long term growth objectives of the City. We do this by creating policies in our Official Plan, and ensuring that development meets the policies. Zoning bylaws are a tool that we use to control how land or buildings are used, the type of buildings that can be constructed, the size and shape of buildings and other associated components such as the number of parking spaces. By controlling these items in zoning bylaws, we ensure that land uses are compatible with neighbouring properties and that there are no adverse impacts created by one property on another. Businesses are not able to obtain a licence unless they are compliant with the zoning bylaws. 2. Building reviews and issues formal permissions for any new building, additions or renovations to begin construction or demolition. A building permit regulates the type of construction allowed in the community and helps to ensure building standards are met and everything complies with the Ontario Building Code and other applicable laws or regulations. The building permit process protects each property owner's interests, as well as those of the community by ensuring that any structural change is safe, legal and sound. 3. Licensing & enforcement ensures that businesses are operating in accordance with zoning, building, fire, health and police regulations, acts and requirements to protect public health and safety in areas related to the business\u2019 operation. Enforcement staff is tasked with upholding the City\u2019s bylaws and ensuring that all residents, businesses and property owners in the City comply with applicable bylaws. Additional services provided by licensing & enforcement can be found here. If staff becomes aware of a business that is operating without a licence, our enforcement team is obligated to investigate the matter and enforce the City\u2019s bylaws. The City\u2019s bylaws do not give staff discretion or flexibility in this regard. All enforcement actions are kept confidential for the business owner\u2019s privacy. If you are a current business owner or plan to open a business, we are here to help you navigate applicable regulations and permissions.

City staff works every day to ensure that economic development and growth opportunities are available to everyone interested \u2013 and to help support current and future business owners get set up for success. The planning, building & licensing department works to help guide businesses through our system, which has been designed to help them thrive. In order to protect the public and ensure development meets the long term growth objectives of the City, we have a number of processes that work together to ensure that businesses are located in areas appropriate for the type of businesses activities they are undertaking and are licensed to ensure they have been reviewed by all necessary departments from a health and safety perspective. Our three departments work together to facilitate this process. 1. Planning manages development in a manner that meets the long term growth objectives of the City. We do this by creating policies in our Official Plan, and ensuring that development meets the policies. Zoning bylaws are a tool that we use to control how land or buildings are used, the type of buildings that can be constructed, the size and shape of buildings and other associated components such as the number of parking spaces. By controlling these items in zoning bylaws, we ensure that land uses are compatible with neighbouring properties and that there are no adverse impacts created by one property on another. Businesses are not able to obtain a licence unless they are compliant with the zoning bylaws. 2. Building reviews and issues formal permissions for any new building, additions or renovations to begin construction or demolition. A building permit regulates the type of construction allowed in the community and helps to ensure building standards are met and everything complies with the Ontario Building Code and other applicable laws or regulations. The building permit process protects each property owner's interests, as well as those of the community by ensuring that any structural change is safe, legal and sound. 3. Licensing & enforcement ensures that businesses are operating in accordance with zoning, building, fire, health and police regulations, acts and requirements to protect public health and safety in areas related to the business\u2019 operation. Enforcement staff is tasked with upholding the City\u2019s bylaws and ensuring that all residents, businesses and property owners in the City comply with applicable bylaws. Additional services provided by licensing & enforcement can be found here. If staff becomes aware of a business that is operating without a licence, our enforcement team is obligated to investigate the matter and enforce the City\u2019s bylaws. The City\u2019s bylaws do not give staff discretion or flexibility in this regard. All enforcement actions are kept confidential for the business owner\u2019s privacy. If you are a current business owner or plan to open a business, we are here to help you navigate applicable regulations and permissions.

This newly launched program is one of many initiatives the City has launched to support collective climate action in the community. Climate change is an issue that affects us all. When we developed the Climate Leadership Plan, we created a road map that would bring us to carbon neutrality by 2040. But to achieve our ambitious targets, we need active participation from everyone in our community. Programs like the Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions are a new way we can help achieve collective action, with champions working directly with their neighbours to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). I am excited by the passionate champions who have volunteered to work with and to inspire their neighbours. I\u2019m amazed by the innovative and unique ideas each champion is bringing forward, and seeing this commitment to climate action, I\u2019m proud to be a member of the Kingston community. In my role as the Manager, Climate Leadership, I have the pleasure of working with staff and the community to implement the ambitious targets identified in the Climate Leadership Plan. Each target was developed with the help of the Kingston community through an in depth consultation process that led to actionable opportunities for reductions in GHG emissions. The Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions will support these GHG emission reductions, acting as one piece of the larger puzzle that will bring us closer to our goal. While the Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions program is just getting started, I\u2019m pleased to share the success of another climate action program that launched in April 2022. Better Homes Kingston is an initiative designed to help Kingston residents make their homes more energy efficient and climate friendly. With residential energy use accounting for an estimated 19% of community GHG emissions, home retrofits are a critical component of climate action initiatives. This program helps homeowners undertake those deep energy retrofits with the help of zero interest loans that can be applied to energy improvements. We began accepting applications in April and we are thrilled by the extraordinary response! This program was intended to run for four years, yet within the first six months of launching, we surpassed our four year target. While that means we have temporarily paused application intake, we invite interested residents to join the program waitlist. The success of Better Homes Kingston truly highlights the passion and commitment to climate action in our community. It gives me great joy to share this achievement and I have no doubt that this milestone is one of many good news stories we\u2019ll be able to share in the coming months. We have come a long way since the City declared a climate emergency in March 2019. Work continues on the ground, led by your neighbours, schools, clubs and workplaces. The City is working hard to change how we operate, reducing our own carbon footprint today and planning for the future. We are making progress, but there is still much work to be done. Through this blog, I hope to bring you updates on our work implementing the Climate Leadership Plan. I plan to share the achievements of our passionate community who are advancing this work individually, as part of community groups and associations, and through programs like the Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions. We must continue to work together to make a difference, and seeing the passion and progress from our community, I am confident we will meet our goal of carbon neutrality by 2040. I will also bring you in depth stories on the climate issues facing our community and how we are working to mitigate, adapt and work together for change. I invite you to follow our work on social media and subscribe to our Climate Action newsletter. We will post new blogs through these channels, along with updates on the Kingston Community Climate Action Fund and the upcoming Climate Change Symposium planned on January 19.

It is a growing concern in Ontario and in Kingston. This invasive weed is often found in roadside ditches, uncultivated land \u2013 and along nature trails. If you see wild parsnip, stay away from it. Why? Because the sap of the plant contains chemicals that can irritate skin and eyes and cause severe burning and blistering on affected skin when it is exposed to the sun. The blisters, which can result in permanent scarring, may occur one to two days after contact with the plant. Interested in wild parsnip? See this Ministry of the Environment fact sheet. Wild parsnip is a highly branched plant, with hollow green stems. It has two growth stages: non flowering leafy rosettes at ground level and 0.5 to 1.5m tall flowering plants. In the first year of growth, low growing non flowering rosettes of leaves form with a cluster of spindly, compound leaves that resemble celery leaves. Second and third year plants have tall, branched flowering stalks that usually bloom in early June to late July. Seeds are flat and round. The seeds can lie dormant for years making it even more challenging to control. Important safety information on wild parsnip hazards, control and disposal is available on the Ontario's Invading Species Awareness Program web site. The City has efforts in place to manage this weed on municipal property. Given the prevalence of this invasive species, eradication is not a viable option. Wild parsnip on your property is your responsibility. For strategies to remove wild parsnip on your property see this Ministry of the Environment fact sheet. Do not burn or compost wild parsnip plants that have been cut down or dug up. If possible, leave the stems to dry out completely at the site. Carefully dispose of plant material in black plastic bags and leave in direct sun for a week or more. Bagged wild parsnip is acceptable as waste at various waste disposal site. Wild parsnip will not be accepted in the green bin program or at the leaf and yard waste site.\" Thanks to the City of Ottawa for sharing its information on this subject with us. Giant Hogweed is an invasive species native to Asia which is becoming more common across North America. The sap of these plants can cause severe burns if not handled correctly. Find out more about Giant Hogweed. Do Not Burn. Do Not Compost. Carefully remove flower heads from stems and place them in black plastic bags. Make sure not to drop any seeds while you are doing this. Seal the bags tightly and leave them in direct sunlight for about a week. Allow stems and roots to dry out thoroughly before disposing of them. Bagged Giant Hogweed is accepted at a number of waste disposal sites in Kingston.

Today, the City is committed to working with Indigenous peoples and all residents to pursue a united path of reconciliation. The City\u2019s work on the projects Engage for Change: YGK Reconciliation Journey and Your Stories, Our Histories have occurred in tandem and have created opportunities for dialogue regarding the history and legacy of Sir John A. Macdonald, especially in a Kingston context. Given that Kingston is widely recognized as Sir John A. Macdonald\u2019s hometown, it is uniquely positioned to engage with its history from a local perspective and in ways that may resonate nationally as well. It is in that context that the following actions were supported by Council on July 8, 2020 as opportunities to begin engaging with history in ways that are more equitable, diverse and inclusive and that celebrate the history of Indigenous Peoples and reframes how we share the history of the City of Kingston and the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe territories on which it is built. Read the full Council Report; Update, 'Your Stories, Our Histories' Project and Strategies to Manage and Interpret the History and Legacy of Sir John A. Macdonald. Action 1: Replace the book plaques adjacent to the monument to Sir John A. Macdonald in City Park and Engine 1095 in Confederation Park with interim notices in their place that indicate new text is under development to tell a more complete and inclusive account of their histories in a Kingston context. Action 2: Form a working group, led by First Peoples Group and supported by staff, that includes both Indigenous and non Indigenous community members, representing a diversity of perspectives, to develop text that addresses issues specific to the history and legacy of Sir John A. Macdonald in Kingston that can be shared online and on site through the City of Kingston website and in relation to local landmarks managed by the City of Kingston. Action 3: Add a land recognition statement, developed by the local Indigenous community, to the City of Kingston website and to all City of Kingston e mail signatures. Action 4: Confirm the City\u2019s support to name the Third Crossing in a way to reflect and celebrate the stories and contributions of Indigenous communities in this region, both past and present. There is still significant work to be done but much has been achieved in five years, since 2015, when the City marked the bicentennial of Sir John A. Macdonald and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission published its report. The \u2018Your Stories, Our Histories\u2019 project provided a critical opportunity to consult with the Kingston community and to ask difficult questions. These actions, endorsed by Council, provide initial opportunities for the City to address issues specific to the history and legacy of Sir John A. Macdonald in Kingston, and how that history and the legacies that resulted, impact people today as conversations around systemic racism and the negative impacts of colonial policies and practices have become more urgent. At a Special Meeting of Council on June 16, 2021 Council directed staff to relocate the Sir John A. Macdonald statue located in City Park to Cataraqui Cemetery, a National Historic Site where Sir John A. Macdonald is buried. The statue is currently being stored in a City storage facility while the City facilitates a consultation process between the Cataraqui Cemetery and the Indigenous communities prior to its installation within the Cataraqui Cemetery \u2013 this consultation will take time and there are no plans for an immediate installation of the statue. City staff are expected to report back to Council on August 10th with details on the future engagement around the statue\u2019s installation. In addition, staff will be developing a multifaceted engagement and consultation plan that will create opportunities for community engagement and input on the new interpretive intentions for the statue\u2019s previous location at City Park. Watch the City Council meeting considering the Sir John A. Macdonald statue. Future public meetings and opportunities for input will be shared online at getinvolved.cityofkingston.ca and additional information will be posted as it is made available. This engagement will be guided with the help of the Sir John A. Macdonald History and Legacy Working Group Community consultation was undertaken with help from the consulting team at First Peoples Group. As consultants, they specialize in offering inclusive engagement and facilitation practices and have worked with all levels of government across Canada. They also offer expertise supporting community education on cultural topics and leading conflict resolution, mediation and negotiation with a focus on consensus building. The involvement of First Peoples Group has been invaluable. Between September 2018 and December 2019 various mechanisms were put in place to formally gather public input about Sir John A. Macdonald and his legacy today. That included setting up tables at community events to engage with the public and providing feedback cards as part of a re installation of the Sir John A. Macdonald Room in City Hall. Input was also sought online through the City of Kingston\u2019s Get Involved platform that likewise sought to gather input related to Sir John A. Macdonald, his history, his relationship to Kingston and his legacies as well as possible next steps that could be taken to develop and share a more inclusive and complete overview and assessment of his life, his politics and his impacts in Kingston and across Canada today. Additional input was also gathered as part of the \u2018Your Stories, Our Histories\u2019 project that engaged more than 1,000 people in 2019. One of the largest engagement events undertaken as part of the community consultation around the history and legacy of Sir John A. Macdonald was the panel discussion held at the Grand Theatre on September 17, 2019. The event featured three prominent Canadian writers, historians, educators and thought leaders offering their perspectives on how to understand, interpret and relate to the history of Sir John A. Macdonald. An audio recording of the event is currently available online via YouTube. This panel discussion was inspired by a series of articles published in the February 2020 edition of Canada\u2019s History magazine written by the speakers, Charlotte Gray, Christopher Moore and Lee Maracle. Their contributions to Canada\u2019s History magazine provided each of the writers with an opportunity to reflect on how best to approach Sir John A. Macdonald as a historical figure, key to the founding of Canada, who is now the centre of much controversy and debate. These writers were asked to share their thoughts as part of the Sir John A. 360\u00b0 panel discussion and to consider how Kingston as a community might position Macdonald in relation to the development of the city, the development of Canada as a nation and the impacts of his legacies that continue to resonate today, both positively and negatively. The panel discussion also served as a lead in to two community workshops through which residents participated in roundtable discussions designed to generate specific ideas around how best to address, interpret and share the history and legacy of Macdonald in a Kingston context for the benefit of residents and visitors. A number of common comments and recurring themes emerged because of the engagement opportunities connected to the \u2018Your Stories, Our Histories\u2019 project and \u2018Sir John A. 360\u00b0\u2019 in particular. These have been summarized below: These themes and the consultations from which they arose were critical in the development of immediate actions as highlighted that respond to the history and legacy of John A. Macdonald. These recommendations are intended to rebalance the historical narrative in Kingston and demonstrate the desire to act in response to issues specific to Sir John A. Macdonald as well as systemic racism, colonialism and the need for reconciliation in Canada more broadly. The four actions will move forward alongside of additional work the City of Kingston is continuing in partnership with the community to strengthen relations with Indigenous peoples and to ensure Indigenous experiences are acknowledged and included as a vital part of Kingston\u2019s history and identity. Many of these efforts are being pursued in the context of \u2018Engage for Change\u2019.

Keep the oven door closed while cooking. The temperature of the oven can drop by as many as 25 degrees each time you open the oven door. Cool food off before putting it in the fridge. When you put something hot into the fridge, the appliance has to work harder to cool it down. Let your food cool down on the counter first. Never leave food out at room temperature for more than two hours and only one hour on a hot day. Avoid using your oven in the summertime. If you avoid using the oven in summer, you will reduce the heat in your home and save on your home cooling costs. Check the temperature of your refrigerator and freezer. Keep your fridge and freezer at their ideal temperature. For your fridge this is between 2\u00b0C and 3\u00b0C and your freezer should be at  18\u00b0C. Skip the heat dry setting for the dishwasher. Your machine will have a setting for heated drying, turn it off and allow your dishes to dry on their own. Use the microwave, slow cooker or toaster oven. Cooking with a microwave, slow cooker or toaster oven instead of a conventional oven can save from 30per cent to as much as 80per cent in energy. To save even more, make sure your smaller appliances are ENERGY STAR\u00ae. Cover pots and pans while cooking. Cover your pots and pans when you\u2019re boiling water or cooking food. This will help prevent the release of heat, allowing the pan to boil faster and use less energy in the process. When cooking, turn your stove\u2019s burners off early. Turn off oven burners a few minutes before you finish cooking. The heat that is stored in the pan and other cooking equipment will allow your food to still cook, but you\u2019ll save energy in the process. Toss a towel in the dryer. A dry towel added to your dryer load can significantly reduce drying times. If you\u2019re doing seven loads a week this could save you $27 a year. Fill your washer. Your washer uses the same amount of energy no matter the size of the load, so fill it up. Clean your dryer\u2019s lint filter regularly. Don\u2019t forget the tubing! Use the long nozzle on your vacuum periodically to clean out particles that get beyond the filter. Minimize your phantom loads. A phantom load is the energy that a plugged in appliance or electronic device uses when it is not turned on. The average Canadian home wastes $150 or more a year on electronic devices that are plugged in but turned off. Eliminate your phantom loads by unplugging appliances and electronics when you are not using them, or by plugging them into a power bar, and turning the power bar off when they are not in use. Stop using your screen saver. Set your computer to sleep or hibernate mode instead of using a screen saver. Many computers and monitors sit idle for hours, wasting energy and driving up your electric bills. You can save about $40 a year just by enabling the power management settings so the computer goes to \u201csleep\u201d after a certain number of idle minutes. Unplug battery chargers when they are not in use. Many chargers draw power continuously, even when the device is not plugged into the charger. Turn off your water heater if you plan on leaving home for a few days. Heating water is the second largest energy user in your home. Since most water heaters will reheat the water to the set temperature in about an hour, turn it off while you're away to save energy. Turn down your furnace. Having people over for a holiday dinner, or doing a lot of cooking in the winter? Turn down the furnace 3 degrees and keep the oven door open when you\u2019re done. Manage your thermostat. Programmable or smart thermostats automatically adjust your home\u2019s temperature to your schedule, keeping it comfortable only when you need it to be. If you don\u2019t already adjust your thermostat throughout the day, a programmable thermostat could save you as much as 15 per cent on heating and cooling costs. If you have an electrically heated home, lower your thermostat by two degrees to save 5per cent on your heating bill. Lowering it five degrees could save 10per cent. Make sure your ceiling fans are going in the right direction. Your ceiling fan should be spinning in reverse during summer. This improves airflow by pulling the cooler air upward and circulating that cool breeze throughout your space. Use natural light. A single south facing window can illuminate 20 to 100 times its area. Turning off one 60 watt bulb for four hours a day is a $9 saving over a year. Use task lighting. Turn off ceiling lights and use table lamps, track lighting, and under counter lights in work and hobby areas as well as in kitchens. Take a shorter shower or shower instead of taking a bath. Heating water is the second largest energy user in your home and heating it is expensive. If two people in your home cut their shower time by a minute each, you could save more than $30 a year. Set a timer while you shower. Fix that leaky toilet A small, more common toilet leak can waste up to 547 litres per day, equaling 200,000 litres a year. This can add up to an extra $90 on every two month water bill.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/projects-construction/infrastructure-projects/faq": "Select a question below to expand the answer. Streets in need of significant repair and/or underground sewer, water and electrical utility work are classed as major reconstruction projects. Streets under major reconstruction will often be closed to traffic with the exception of local residents and access to businesses. It is extremely difficult to determine the exact date a major reconstruction project will begin. Other considerations, such as the need to minimize impact on traffic flow or take advantage of the opportunities to maximize budget and workload efficiencies, may also lead to delays. For instance, sidewalks in some neighbourhoods (i.e. Calvin Park) were originally scheduled to be replaced over a number of years and this project has since been consolidated into a single year, delaying sidewalk replacements in other areas. Unexpected delays due to weather and working conditions will often occur and are beyond the City's control. However, as the construction date draws near, you will be notified. Approximately one month before the project begins, the tender is advertised in the newspaper. The tender invites contractors to bid on a reconstruction project. Around the same time property owners will receive an introductory letter from the City advising that a reconstruction project will be taking place adjacent to their property. Two to three weeks before the project is scheduled to begin, the City and Utilities Kingston will hold a meeting with affected property owners and street residents. A letter about an information meeting on the upcoming project will be sent to each property owner . Two to three weeks before the project begins, an information package is sent to each property owner announcing the name of the successful contractor with contact information and the contractor's responsibility. Also included in the package are: Continue to place your garbage and recycling at street side before 6 a.m. on your usual collection day. The contractor is responsible for moving your garbage and recycling from the front of your property to the corner of the street. The City will collect at the corner on your usual collection day. Please clearly mark your address on your Blue and Grey Box, Green Bin or garbage can and the contractor will return them to the front of your property. As part of the contract agreement, if your lawn or driveway is affected by reconstruction, the contractor will restore your driveway, walk and lawn to their original form. The City will not replace trees, hedges or flower beds planted on the right of way. If there is construction in front of your home, you will not have access to your driveway. Before the project you will receive an information package explaining how to get an on street parking pass (if necessary) allowing you to park on the street overnight without being ticketed. You will have access to your property at all times through access created by the contractor. Accessibility accommodations can be made for residents with disabilities or residents who use mobility devices. Once the construction has finished in front of your home, you will be free to access your driveway. Trees may be in the way of underground infrastructure, or they may be aged or diseased and in danger of falling. The City has trained arborists inspect trees before construction and make recommendations on whether a tree poses a danger to pedestrians or property. Resurfacing refers to a number of different construction techniques where, generally, a new surface is added on top of the existing surface. The overlay/resurfacing process and materials will vary depending on the current condition and usage of the street. In some cases, the existing asphalt is ground, leaving an uneven surface for a few days before a new asphalt surface is placed. In most cases you will not be personally notified prior to resurfacing. Find out more about the Microsurfacing and Fibremat processes used by the City. \"Construction\" refers to a new sidewalk where no sidewalk exists. \"Reconstruction\" refers to removing and replacing an existing sidewalk. A letter will be sent to your home prior to construction or reconstruction. A sidewalk access ramp is usually found on a street corner. The access ramp provides pedestrians using a wheelchair, walker or stroller with safe passage from sidewalk to street or street to sidewalk. Bus stops will also be upgraded or added as required during sidewalk construction. The contractor provides written notice to affected property owners at least 48 hours ahead of a planned utility shutoff. Some shutoffs may be only a few hours \u2013 as with switchovers to temporary water feeds \u2013 or longer, as with switchovers to new water mains. Unanticipated shutoffs due to damaged water main valves and other unforeseen circumstances may also be required during construction. Yes. The City and Utilities Kingston provide updates on road closures to Emergency Services at all times. Emergency services will be aware of access issues in your areas. If bus routes are affected by construction, Kingston Transit will create detours and temporary bus stops along the detoured route. Vist the detours page for more information, or call 613 546 0000, or listen to Information Radio 106.3 FM. The City has rated all of the streets based on their current condition and usage. A priority list has been created from this collected data. Using the priority list, the City coordinates its efforts and budgets with the water, sewer, gas and electrical priorities of Utilities Kingston. Those streets rating highest on the combined list have been considered first priority for the four year Infrastructure Program. The information collected will also be used to determine construction and reconstruction programs in future years. The City is committed to providing up to date information here. As construction dates are confirmed, the information will be added to the website. Additional contact information will also be available on the website or by contacting us (see details at right).

The City offers the following locations for launching your boat:", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment-sustainability/water-quality/wastewater": "Wastewater is the flow of used water from a community. The characteristics of the wastewater discharges will vary from location to location depending upon the population and industrial sector served, land uses, groundwater levels, and degree of separation between storm water and sanitary wastes. Domestic wastewater includes typical wastes from the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry, as well as any other wastes that people may accidentally or intentionally pour down the drain. Sanitary wastewater consists of domestic wastewater as well as those discharged from commercial, institutional, and similar facilities. Industrial wastes will be as varied as the industries that generate the wastes. The quantities of storm water that combines with the domestic wastewater will vary with the degree of separation that exists between the storm sewers and the sanitary sewers. Most new sewerage systems are separate, collect sanitary wastewater and storm wastes, whereas older combined systems collect both sanitary wastewater and storm water. Stormwater runoff is precipitation that finds its way across and surfaces into receiving waters. Urban storm runoff is collected and transported in storm or combined sewers. Storm sewers carry stormwater only; combined sewers also carry sanitary wastewater. Combined wastewater in dry weather is composed of sanitary wastewater. Since the pipes are sized to carry high flows in wet weather, in dry weather they may allow solids to settle out. In wet weather combined wastewater composition at any time depends on the extent to which sanitary wastewater is diluted by stormwater, and is augmented by contaminants in stormwater and in the solids deposited in dry weather and scoured in wet weather flows. The drains (catch basins) along the curbs of our city streets are connected by sewer pipes directly to our creeks, rivers and Lake Ontario. Whatever goes down the catch basins will flow directly out into the natural environment. Every property in the city contributes to this stormwater flow! There are three main types of sewers within the City of Kingston: Most of our rainwater travels through gutters, storm drains, channels, washes and eventually into the major source of our drinking water, Lake Ontario. As we mentioned above, it is often difficult to determine any one thing that is causing water pollution. Environmentalist have made great strides over the past 50 years however we are continuously learning more about the impact of our actions on our natural environment and what we need to do about it. During heavy rainstorms and rapid snowmelt, extra flow from stormwater runoff into these combined sewers is greater than the interceptor pipes and treatment plant can accommodate. At these times the combined wastewater (including the stormwater runoff) overtop flow regulator structures, resulting in combined sewer overflows to the Lake and River.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/pay?p_p_id=kingstonpaymentsportlet_WAR_kingstonpaymentsportlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=_118_INSTANCE_mIrojY3TeRAO__column-1&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=2&_kingstonpaymentsportlet_WAR_kingstonpaymentsportlet_render=payments&_kingstonpaymentsportlet_WAR_kingstonpaymentsportlet_ProductId=poa2103": "Please enter the following information as it appears on your Notice of Fine and Due Date.

The Ministry's Air Quality Ontario office monitors air quality daily, issues alerts or warnings when smog levels are present and provides historical air quality information. Clean Air Day was proclaimed by the Government of Canada as the Wednesday of Environment Week, and was officially launched on June 2, 1999. The Day was declared in response to a request made by several community organizations across the country. Since the early 1990s, every year in May and June, environmental, health and transportation groups have organized clean air related community activities. Below are some tips for making every day \"Clean Air Day.\" Please select a heading from the following menu for further information: Walk, cycle or take public transit. Emissions from cars, trucks and buses contribute greatly to Ontario's smog problem. Leave your car at home, if possible, or limit car trips by doing all your errands at once. Hold a teleconference instead of travelling to meetings. To reduce your exposure to exhaust fumes, stay away from heavy traffic areas when walking or cycling. If you must drive, try carpooling. And keep your car well tuned. A well maintained car runs better and pollutes less. Shut the engine off, even for short stops  one minute of idling uses more fuel than restarting your engine. Drive at moderate speeds and check your tires regularly. Refuel your car after sundown when air pollution levels are lower and gasoline vapours won't add to the problem. Generating electricity contributes to smog, so remember to turn off the lights whenever you don't need them. Air conditioning uses up energy, some of which is supplied by oil and coal fired generators which emit pollutants that contribute to smog. Increasing the temperature in your home or place of work by a few degrees is a small price to pay to reduce hydro usage and help improve air quality. You'd hardly think that mowing the lawn contributes to smog, but it does. Small gasoline engines in mowers, chain saws and leaf blowers emit high levels of pollutants that cause smog. On smog alert days put off mowing the lawn to another day. Use electric powered or, even better, manual tools which don't produce any pollution. Avoid using aerosol sprays/cleaners, oil based paints and other chemical products that contribute to poor air quality indoors and outdoors. Whether it's lighting up your gas barbecue or, a cigarette, the smoke will only add more pollutants and further deteriorate air quality in and around your home. Take a break  don't smoke, and enjoy light meals that require little or no cooking. Smog is a mixture of ground level ozone, toxic gases and airborne particles that can damage both human health and the environment. The contaminants that create smog are released during the combustion of fossil fuels in our vehicles, power plants, factory boilers and homes. They are also released by industrial processes, the evaporation of liquid fuels and the use of solvents and other volatile products such as oil based paints.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/getting-around": "The City offers a number of services and maintains infrastructure that help Kingstonians get where they want to go.

Client: Frontenac Standard Condominium Corporation The challenge in this project was to bring a large scale building mass into a settled and well established streetscape and block structure of low rise historical buildings. Much of the detailing and material choice were introduced to mitigate and enhance the change in scale, and to break the building mass down into simple pieces. The building was conceived in a spirit of contextuality while free from the pitfalls of being locked into stylistic constraints. Kingston\u2019s approach to focus on material and massing compatibility has allowed this building to reach a design potential that would not be possible in a more stylistically strict approval process.Post By: Web AdminPost Date: 2017 11 27Shot By: Shot Location: 121 Queen Street Designer: Colbourne and Kembel, Architects Inc.

Most households have, on average, 4 6 appliances that produce carbon monoxide some examples are: Exposure to CO can cause flu like symptoms such as headaches, nausea and dizziness, as well as confusion, drowsiness, loss of consciousness and death. If your CO alarm sounds and you or other occupants suffer from symptoms of CO poisoning, get everyone out of the home immediately. Then call 9 1 1 or your local emergency services number from outside the building. If your CO alarm sounds and no one is suffering from symptoms of CO poisoning, check to see if the battery needs replacing, or the alarm has reached its \"end of life\" before calling 9 1 1. Since CO alarms do not detect fire or smoke and smoke alarms do not detect CO, your home needs both CO and smoke alarms. Ensure fuel burning appliances, chimneys and vents are cleaned and inspected by professionals every year before cold weather sets in. Ensure vents for the dryer, furnace, stove, fireplace and other fuel burning appliances are always be clear of snow and other debris. Gas and charcoal barbeques must be used outside, away from all doors, windows, vents, and other building openings. Never use barbeques inside garages, even if the garage doors are open. Portable fuel burning generators must be used outdoors in well ventilated areas away from windows, doors, vents and other building openings. Ensure all portable fuel burning heaters are vented properly, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Never use the stove or oven to heat your home. Open the flu for adequate ventilation before using a fireplace . Never run a vehicle or other fuelled engine or motor inside a garage, even if the garage doors are open. Always remove a vehicle from the garage immediately after starting it. Test CO alarms every month by pressing the test button. Replace batteries every year. Replace CO alarms according to the manufacturer's instructions. Your CO alarm sounds different than your smoke alarm. Test both alarms monthly and make sure everyone in your home knows the difference between the two alarm sounds. Know the difference between the CO alarm's low battery warning, end of life warning and an emergency alarm \u2013 consult the CO alarm manufacturer's instructions. Carbon monoxide alarms should be replaced every 5 7 years as per the manufactures instructions. If your home has a fuel burning appliance, a fireplace or an attached garage, install a carbon monoxide alarm adjacent to each sleeping area. Fuel burning appliances include furnaces, hot water heaters, gas or wood fireplaces, portable fuel burning heaters and generators, barbeques, stoves and vehicles. If you live in an apartment or condo building: If there is a fuel burning appliance in your condo/apartment, install a carbon monoxide alarm adjacent to each sleeping area. If your building has a service room, carbon monoxide alarms must be installed in the service room and adjacent to each sleeping area of all condos/apartments above, below and beside the service room. If your building has a garage, carbon monoxide alarms must be installed adjacent to each sleeping area of all condos/apartments above, below and beside the garage. For added protection, install a carbon monoxide alarm on every storey of the home according to manufacturer's instructions. Always follow the manufactures recommend installation instruction for clearance and distance from obstruction and appliances. In general, \"adjacent to each sleeping area\" means the hallway serving or area outside the sleeping area. For instance, a CO alarm must be installed in the hallway adjacent to multiple bedrooms in a house or apartment.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/pay?p_p_id=kingstonpaymentsportlet_WAR_kingstonpaymentsportlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_kingstonpaymentsportlet_WAR_kingstonpaymentsportlet_ProductId=poa2101&_kingstonpaymentsportlet_WAR_kingstonpaymentsportlet_l=en&_kingstonpaymentsportlet_WAR_kingstonpaymentsportlet_render=payments": "Please enter the following information as it appears on your Offence Notice.

This newly launched program is one of many initiatives the City has launched to support collective climate action in the community. Climate change is an issue that affects us all. When we developed the Climate Leadership Plan, we created a road map that would bring us to carbon neutrality by 2040. But to achieve our ambitious targets, we need active participation from everyone in our community. Programs like the Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions are a new way we can help achieve collective action, with champions working directly with their neighbours to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). I am excited by the passionate champions who have volunteered to work with and to inspire their neighbours. I\u2019m amazed by the innovative and unique ideas each champion is bringing forward, and seeing this commitment to climate action, I\u2019m proud to be a member of the Kingston community. In my role as the Manager, Climate Leadership, I have the pleasure of working with staff and the community to implement the ambitious targets identified in the Climate Leadership Plan. Each target was developed with the help of the Kingston community through an in depth consultation process that led to actionable opportunities for reductions in GHG emissions. The Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions will support these GHG emission reductions, acting as one piece of the larger puzzle that will bring us closer to our goal. While the Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions program is just getting started, I\u2019m pleased to share the success of another climate action program that launched in April 2022. Better Homes Kingston is an initiative designed to help Kingston residents make their homes more energy efficient and climate friendly. With residential energy use accounting for an estimated 19% of community GHG emissions, home retrofits are a critical component of climate action initiatives. This program helps homeowners undertake those deep energy retrofits with the help of zero interest loans that can be applied to energy improvements. We began accepting applications in April and we are thrilled by the extraordinary response! This program was intended to run for four years, yet within the first six months of launching, we surpassed our four year target. While that means we have temporarily paused application intake, we invite interested residents to join the program waitlist. The success of Better Homes Kingston truly highlights the passion and commitment to climate action in our community. It gives me great joy to share this achievement and I have no doubt that this milestone is one of many good news stories we\u2019ll be able to share in the coming months. We have come a long way since the City declared a climate emergency in March 2019. Work continues on the ground, led by your neighbours, schools, clubs and workplaces. The City is working hard to change how we operate, reducing our own carbon footprint today and planning for the future. We are making progress, but there is still much work to be done. Through this blog, I hope to bring you updates on our work implementing the Climate Leadership Plan. I plan to share the achievements of our passionate community who are advancing this work individually, as part of community groups and associations, and through programs like the Neighbourhood Climate Action Champions. We must continue to work together to make a difference, and seeing the passion and progress from our community, I am confident we will meet our goal of carbon neutrality by 2040. I will also bring you in depth stories on the climate issues facing our community and how we are working to mitigate, adapt and work together for change. I invite you to follow our work on social media and subscribe to our Climate Action newsletter. We will post new blogs through these channels, along with updates on the Kingston Community Climate Action Fund and the upcoming Climate Change Symposium planned on January 19.

City staff works every day to ensure that economic development and growth opportunities are available to everyone interested \u2013 and to help support current and future business owners get set up for success. The planning, building & licensing department works to help guide businesses through our system, which has been designed to help them thrive. In order to protect the public and ensure development meets the long term growth objectives of the City, we have a number of processes that work together to ensure that businesses are located in areas appropriate for the type of businesses activities they are undertaking and are licensed to ensure they have been reviewed by all necessary departments from a health and safety perspective. Our three departments work together to facilitate this process. 1. Planning manages development in a manner that meets the long term growth objectives of the City. We do this by creating policies in our Official Plan, and ensuring that development meets the policies. Zoning bylaws are a tool that we use to control how land or buildings are used, the type of buildings that can be constructed, the size and shape of buildings and other associated components such as the number of parking spaces. By controlling these items in zoning bylaws, we ensure that land uses are compatible with neighbouring properties and that there are no adverse impacts created by one property on another. Businesses are not able to obtain a licence unless they are compliant with the zoning bylaws. 2. Building reviews and issues formal permissions for any new building, additions or renovations to begin construction or demolition. A building permit regulates the type of construction allowed in the community and helps to ensure building standards are met and everything complies with the Ontario Building Code and other applicable laws or regulations. The building permit process protects each property owner's interests, as well as those of the community by ensuring that any structural change is safe, legal and sound. 3. Licensing & enforcement ensures that businesses are operating in accordance with zoning, building, fire, health and police regulations, acts and requirements to protect public health and safety in areas related to the business\u2019 operation. Enforcement staff is tasked with upholding the City\u2019s bylaws and ensuring that all residents, businesses and property owners in the City comply with applicable bylaws. Additional services provided by licensing & enforcement can be found here. If staff becomes aware of a business that is operating without a licence, our enforcement team is obligated to investigate the matter and enforce the City\u2019s bylaws. The City\u2019s bylaws do not give staff discretion or flexibility in this regard. All enforcement actions are kept confidential for the business owner\u2019s privacy. If you are a current business owner or plan to open a business, we are here to help you navigate applicable regulations and permissions.

Select a topic from the following menu for more information: Most property owners will receive two municipal tax bills from the City each year. In addition, tax billings are separated into 2 groups: Property owners who have a property assessed in both of these groups will receive two tax bills. To determine your property's total taxes, add together the amounts interim taxes (or final taxes) from the tax bill summary sections. If you receive two tax bills, please be aware that any arrears or credits will show on the uncapped bill only. Payments will be applied according to payment application information. ePost was retired in December 2022; however, the City is currently developing a portal that will allow residents to receive their tax bills electronically and view their tax account information.

This webpage will be updated as information becomes available on this exciting new venture. Supplementary and omitted tax bills are sent out as a result of a change in your property during the taxation year. These changes can include, but are not limited to: new residential homes, new commercial, residential or multi residential units, changes in tax classes, additions or renovations to buildings and previously exempt properties that become taxable. These bills follow the Property Assessment Change Notice issued by MPAC. MPAC is responsible for assessing the properties and forwarding the information to the City for billing. Sometimes these bills can span more than one year depending on when an MPAC assessor is able to visit your property. Supplementary and omitted tax bills are usually issued twice per year (early fall and late fall) and are in addition to any other tax bills that may have been issued. Each bill includes the effective date and change reason. They are due in one instalment and notice is provided at least 21 days before the payment is due. Preauthorized payments are automatically debited from your bank account, which ensures your property taxes are always paid on time. Three plans to choose from: Use the Preauthorized Tax Payment Application to have your property taxes automatically debited from your bank account in 10 instalments (on the first business day of each month January through October): Use the Pre authorized Tax Payment Application to have your property taxes automatically debited from your bank account in regular instalments: interim and final instalments are withdrawn on each regular instalment due date (interim payment is last business day in February and the final payment is last business day in June).

With the effects of climate change already impacting our community and beyond, collective action is essential for moving toward a more sustainable Kingston. There are many organizations in our community that are already working to create a more resilient and low carbon Kingston. I was pleased to bring together many of these groups at the first Climate Leadership Working Group (CLWG) meeting late last month. Our goal \u2013 to identify new opportunities for climate action, at the community level, that will help us move closer to our goal of carbon neutrality by 2040. Many of these organizations participated in the development of the Climate Leadership Plan (CLP) through the extensive community engagement undertaken throughout the process. We also welcomed some new representatives, and while they may not have been involved directly with the CLP, they have worked hard to advance climate action at an individual level and as members of their organizations. Each member of the CLWG is doing great work in our community. I invite you to review the full list of our members and if their work inspires you to act, please follow their social media, subscribe to their newsletters and share their great work with your friends and family. While the CLWG is a new group that will make recommendations on the implementation of the actions within the CLP and help us realize our goals, the Kingston Community Climate Action Fund (KCCAF) has launched for its third year! The KCCAF was established as a way to empower organizations to become part of city wide solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These organizations apply to participate in the fund, and when approved, fundraise to complete individual community climate action projects. This year, the KCCAF is seeking to raise over $110,000 to support three climate action projects.100% of all funds raised will go directly to these Kingston charities and contributions will be matched up to $5,000 thanks to the generosity of the Kingston Community Credit Union. Building climate resiliency isn\u2019t easy. It requires active participation from the entire community. The KCCAF helps organizations realize their sustainability goals by contributing funds for projects that may not be possible otherwise. It also provides an opportunity for the entire community to get involved in climate action by supporting causes that not only reduce overall GHG emissions but also offer additional benefits to the Kingston community. Among those benefits are the creation of much needed accessible daycare spaces, improved access to outdoor spaces for those with developmental disabilities and increased awareness of energy conservation in our community. Donating to the KCCAF makes a difference in more ways than one. And with that in mind, I\u2019m pleased to share this year\u2019s projects and organizations: Frontenac Club Day Care is seeking your support for building retrofits that will create 22 new licensed daycare spaces in Kingston and a new wheelchair accessible preschool and infant room. These building retrofits include the installation of two new heat pump systems in both the coach house and infant house well as spray foam insulation, improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Ongwanada is seeking your support to purchase an electric wheelchair transport bike that can be used to take the residents of Ongwanada on outdoor excursions in Kingston to help maintain their mental and physical health. The electric bike will provide the necessary support residents need while enjoying the outdoors and staying active. These bikes would reduce Ongwanada\u2019s contribution to GHGs by taking residents out for excursions in an electric powered bike instead of a fossil fuel burning van. Sustainable Kingston is seeking your support for the purchase of an electric vehicle that will replace gas powered vehicle use. This electric vehicle will be used by the Residential Energy Auditors when they perform home energy audits across Kingston, directly reducing GHGs and promoting energy conservation. We are thankful for those who have already donated in support of the KCCAF and these deserving organizations. If you are looking for a way to take real, local, and measurable climate action, we encourage you to donate to the KCCAF now through March 31. Donate online today!

Let's work together to prevent concussions and make Kingston a safer place to play. A concussion is a brain injury caused by a force to the head that causes the brain to move rapidly within the skull. They can be difficult to diagnose as there may be no visible signs, but ignoring a concussion can have serious negative effects. Watch the video.

The fine for running a red light is currently $325, and the ticket is issued to the registered owner of the vehicle regardless of who is driving the vehicle. Details on how to pay fines online, by mail, or by phone, or to contest one are available at the link below. Pay ticket online Red light cameras are located following intersections: View the full Red light cameras map application. Locations were determined through review of collision data from all of the City\u2019s signalized intersections, potential safety benefits and the suitability of the sites. Red light cameras are a form of traffic enforcement that involves photographing a vehicle when it enters an intersection while the traffic signal is red. The system works by capturing two pictures, one as the vehicle approaches the stop bar, and another after the vehicle enters the intersection. Both photos are taken while the light is red, and the cameras photograph the rear of the vehicle to ensure the licence plate is visible in the pictures. These images are then reviewed by Provincial Offences Officers to confirm the charge. If a violation is confirmed, a ticket is mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle, including the photos, information about the offence and how to pay or contest the charge. A driver that enters the intersection when the traffic signal is green or amber will not receive a ticket. A driver that stops on or just slightly past the stop bar will also not receive a ticket. Only drivers who cross the stop bar and proceed through the intersection while the traffic signal is red will receive a ticket. Red light cameras are an automated enforcement tool focused on improving driver behaviour to reduce red light running and increase safety. Violations are processed through a centralized processing center operated by the City of Toronto. Provincial Offences Officers carefully review every photograph to verify information and to confirm the red light violation. Tickets are then mailed to registered vehicle owners only if the photographs clearly show that the vehicle ran the red light. The local court system is responsible for any violation appeals. No, only vehicles that fully cross the stop bar and enter the intersection while the traffic signal is red will receive a ticket. As long as the vehicle enters the intersection while the traffic signal is green or amber, the left turning motorist will not be ticketed for completing the turn when the traffic signal is red. As long as the vehicle comes to complete a stop before the stop bar prior to making a right turn in accordance with the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, the motorist will not be ticketed for making a permitted right turn on red. In accordance with the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, motorists are not permitted to proceed through a red light unless they are being directed by a police officer who is directly controlling the signalized intersection. If motorists in a funeral procession are being directed through a signalized intersection by a police officer who is directly controlling the intersection in accordance with the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, the motorists will not be ticketed for driving through the red light. It is important that motorists adjust their driving to the condition of the road. Red light cameras will continue to function in bad weather including snow, ice, fog and rain. However, for a ticket to be issued the stop bar must appear clearly in the image. If snow or ice obscures the stop bar, the Provincial Offences Officer reviewing the photos will not issue a ticket. No. The cameras only photograph vehicles that enter an intersection after the traffic signal has turned red. Vehicles that enter the intersection while the traffic signal is green or amber will not be photographed. The set fine for running a red light is currently $325, which is issued to the registered owner of the vehicle. This charge includes $260 that would be forwarded to the City of Kingston, a $60 victim surcharge for Province of Ontario and a $5 court cost for the local provincial court. Since the registered owner of the vehicle may not actually be the driver that ran the red light, demerit points are NOT issued with red light camera tickets. The registered license plate holder receives the ticket, regardless of who was driving the vehicle. Tickets must be mailed out within 23 days of the offence occurring. Typically, once the ticket is in the mail it will be delivered within a week. This means that you would most likely receive your ticket within 30 days of the offence occurring.

Client: Frontenac Standard Condominium Corporation The challenge in this project was to bring a large scale building mass into a settled and well established streetscape and block structure of low rise historical buildings. Much of the detailing and material choice were introduced to mitigate and enhance the change in scale, and to break the building mass down into simple pieces. The building was conceived in a spirit of contextuality while free from the pitfalls of being locked into stylistic constraints. Kingston\u2019s approach to focus on material and massing compatibility has allowed this building to reach a design potential that would not be possible in a more stylistically strict approval process.Post By: Web AdminPost Date: 2017 11 27Shot By: Shot Location: 121 Queen Street Designer: Colbourne and Kembel, Architects Inc.

Festivities can turn tragic as a result of unattended cooking, faulty decorative lighting and careless use of candles. To help keep your family safe over the holidays, Kingston Fire & Rescue is highlighting these 12 potentially life saving safety tips. Keep the base of the trunk in water at all times. Keep your tree away from any ignition source such as the fireplace, heaters or candles. Before you put up lights check the cords closely. Discard any sets that are frayed or damaged. Never plug more than three strings of lights together. Never connect LED to conventional lights. This is likely to wear out LED bulbs more rapidly and could pose a fire or electrical hazard. It's the law to have working smoke alarms on every storey of your home and outside all sleeping areas. Test alarms monthly and replace batteries once per year or choose models with 10 year sealed \"Worry Free\" batteries that never need to be changed. Check the age of your smoke alarms. Develop and practice a home fire escape plan with everyone in your family as well as your guests over the holidays. Once outside, stay outside and call 911 from a cellphone or neighbour's house. Determine who will be responsible for helping anyone who may need assistance. It's the law in Ontario. If your home has an attached garage, fuel burning wood or gas fireplace or other device, you must have a working CO alarm near every sleeping area. For protection, install one on every storey. Like smoke alarms, CO alarms wear out. Check the age of your CO alarms and replace according to manufacturer's instructions. Avoid overloading circuits with plugs and extension cords, as this can create overheating that could result in fire. Never put cords under rugs. Keep them at least one metre (3 feet) away from anything that can burn such as curtains, upholstery, or holiday decorations. Avoid using real candles, opting instead for safer flameless candles. If you use real candles, remember to blow them out before leaving the room or going to bed. Keep lit candles safely away from children and pets and anything that can burn. Matches and lighters can be deadly in the hands of children. If you smoke, have only one lighter or book of matches and keep it with you at all times. Always stay in the kitchen and pay attention to your cooking  especially if using oil or high temperatures. If a pot catches fire, carefully slide a tight fitting lid over the pot to smother the flames and then turn off the heat. Careless smoking is the leading cause of fatal fires. Encourage smokers to smoke outside and use large, deep ashtrays that can't be knocked over. Make sure cigarette butts are properly extinguished. With all the festive cheer this time of year, keep a close eye on anyone attempting to cook or smoke while under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol is often a common factor in many fatal fires.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/emergency-services/kingston-fire-rescue/safety-prevention/personal": "Learn more about personal fire safety via the list below.

The risk of death or injury from fire is often greater for people with physical, mental or sensory disabilities. Identifying each person's individual risk factors allows for preparation of measures to offset those dangers. Why are people with disabilities at Risk? People with disabilities should be aware of the special fire warning devices that are available. Although you have the legal right to live where you choose, you'll be safest on the ground floor if you live in an apartment building. Never use elevators during a fire emergency.

As the popularity of candles brings an increase in fires started by candles, Kingston Fire & Rescue Services is urging everyone to practice safe candle use. According to the National Candle Association, 7 out of 10 North American households use candles. At the same time, National Fire Protection Association research shows that candles are a common cause of home fires. In recent years, candle fires in the home were responsible for an estimated 190 civilian deaths, 1,450 civilian injuries and $265 million in property damage. Four out of ten candle fires start in the bedroom and one in six start in common rooms, living rooms, family rooms or dens. Nearly half the people killed by candle fires in the home were younger than 20; children ages 5 to 9 accounted for a disproportionate share of the victims, with a candle fire death rate 2.5 times higher than the general population. Just like your home, your cottage or cabin must have working smoke alarms on every storey. It's the law. The following safety tips will help to keep you and your family safe during the holiday season. Home escape plans are often referred to as EDITH \u2014 Exit Drills In The Home. The high cost of home heating fuels and utilities have caused many people to search for alternate sources of home heating \u2014 namely portable space heaters. These methods of supplemental heating may be acceptable; however, they are a major contributing factor in residential fires. These fire safety tips can help you prevent fires and maintain a fire safe home. The number one cause of residential fires in North America is from cooking. Kingston Fire & Rescue offers the following fire safety tips to follow when cooking: Space heaters are the leading cause of home fires during December, January and February \u2014 but such disasters can be prevented with a few simple precautions. Have annual safety checks, inspections, and necessary repairs on all home heating equipment (including kerosene and gas space heaters) performed by qualified service technicians. Consumers should be aware of the hazards when buying and using gas, kerosene, and electric space heaters. Fires and burns may occur from contact with or close proximity to the flame, heating element, or hot surface area. Fires and explosions may be caused by flammable fuels or defective wiring. Indoor air pollution or carbon monoxide poisoning can be caused by improper venting or incomplete combustion of fuel burning equipment. Consult your operator's manual for instructions or recommended maintenance to ensure the heater's proper operation. Required maintenance should include periodically cleaning the unit, trimming the wick, cleaning off soot and carbon, inspecting for fuel leaks and procedures recommended by the manufacturer. If you suspect the heater is not working properly, extinguish it immediately and allow it to cool. Take it to a qualified service technician for repair. An improperly operating heater can result in a fire or can generate an excessive amount of the byproducts of combustion: soot, carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide. Always use the correct fuel for your heater. Adequate ventilation is necessary for safe operation of the kerosene heater. Burning kerosene consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and other gases. Ventilation must be provided to replace oxygen as well as to remove gases in order to prevent asphyxiation or respiratory problems. The manufacturer's recommendations should be followed to provide adequate oxygen for combustion. In an energy efficient home, additional air intake may be necessary. The heater should never be used as the only heat source, except in an emergency situation. Do not leave a heater unattended.", "https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/emergency-services/kingston-fire-rescue/safety-prevention/construction": "Larger construction projects \u2013 those greater than two storeys or more than 600 square meters \u2013 have specific fire safety considerations.

Of course, to reach goal of carbon neutrality by 2040 we need to go further than that. The greater the reduction in household energy use the be To reach our emissions reduction targets, and keep our city and homes healthy and safe over the coming decades, we need to deep retrofit as many of our local homes as possible by 2040. This is because deep retrofits massively reduce energy consumption and allow us to switch our remaining energy needs to clean energy. The deeper the retrofit you plan, the greater incentives you may qualify for from Better Homes Kingston, as well as other eligible rebates and incentive based programs such as the Canada Greener Homes Grant. Deep retrofits may have significant costs, but the good news is, they improve our homes, making them healthier, more resilient, and less expensive to heat and cool over the long term. The same changes to your home that allow reducing energy consumption can also allow you to stay comfortable inside during a power failure, to produce your own energy, or to improve your indoor air quality. Wins all around. 20 per cent of Canadians live in energy poverty? This means they spend more than 6per cent of their after tax income on energy expenses, sometimes going without food or other essentials, just to keep warm.\u201d Deep energy retrofits can pull these numbers back into balance and keep more money in the pockets of local residents who need it most. Deep retrofits are popular with economists and all our governments for one other big reason: deep retrofits create good, green, local jobs. We can meet our local targets, improve our homes, and jump start our post covid local economies, all by retrofitting our homes. A deep retrofit is a home energy retrofit that reduces your household energy consumption by 50 per cent or more. Deep retrofits improve our homes, making them healthier, more resilient, and less expensive to heat and cool over the long term. The big benefit of a deep retrofit over a shallow retrofit (10 30 per cent savings) is long term gains. When you start saving big today, the cumulative gains (in energy and emissions reductions) over the years are much larger, and that makes a difference for meeting our targets, saving money, and supporting a resilient clean energy system. Retrofits are a good bet, and deep ones are even better. Our governments agree, and they are jumping on board to encourage residents to retrofit their homes with incentives, rebates and financing support. That means your deep retrofit will be easier and cheaper.

All locations have staff who can coordinate referrals to a variety of supports, including housing services and more. The City Encampment Protocol/Procedure is intended to guide staff and partners in providing outreach services to homeless individuals camping outside in public spaces by providing individuals with access to alternative solutions prior to the enforcement of City bylaws, which may lead to the displacement of individuals and the removal of their belongings. The intent is for the City and its partners to assist people camping in public spaces to access safer and healthier alternatives to living outside, including housing, support services and shelter. The protocol also provides a balance between the provision of supports to vulnerable populations camping in public spaces with the City\u2019s desire to maintain intended access and use of public spaces. The objective of this protocol is to establish a clear process for City departments and partners that focuses on a proactive and supportive approach to help vulnerable individuals camping in public spaces relocate to alternative service options prior to any enforcement activities related to public spaces (e.g., such as the removal of unauthorized structures, personal goods and debris). It is always the objective of City staff and its\u2019 partners\u2019 to assist individuals in voluntarily vacating public spaces and securing improved alternatives to sleeping outside, making enforcement unnecessary. In order to be successful and truly support individuals in need, assessments must be performed on a case by case basis, as the needs of individuals camping in public spaces will vary greatly.
