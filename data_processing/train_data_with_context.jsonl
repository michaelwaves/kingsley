I~ve been with the City since 2009 and one of my first tasks was to develop the Kingston Culture Plan\u2014a first for the City of Kingston. Since that time, I~ve had the chance to work with people across the community who like me share a passion for making sure Kingston~s cultural life is vibrant, enjoyable and accessible. Kingston hasn~t always been home but it~s certainly where my passions first emerged. Like many people, my family moved to Kingston when my father took a job at Queen~s University. That was in 1973 when Kingston celebrated its Tercentenary. Kingston then hosted the sailing competitions as part of the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, which was a proud moment and inspired all kinds of cultural activities. As a young person, I felt inspired to get involved in the cultural life of the city and those early experiences set me on a path that included lots of different creative pursuits and I eventually went to Queen~s University to study art, art history and drama. During those years I also worked in the Grand Theatre box office and volunteered as a tour guide at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre before moving on to Toronto to pursue a graduate degree in Museum Studies. For many years I worked in public galleries in and around Ontario and, with every job, it was always important to me to find ways to help people connect with art and history in different and interesting ways. That~s something I now get to do every day in my role as cultural director with the City of Kingston and it excites me to be able to use this blog to share stories to help show some of the ways in which people are working to foster creativity, to learn, to share and to continue to feel proud about Kingston and all the things it has to offer that makes it so unique.\n\nPassPERKS, Kingston Transit~s loyalty program, will provide riders who have monthly photo ID passes opportunities to save at a growing list of local stores and services.

My team and I have the privilege of providing our City with guidance and strategies for building a vibrant future. It is a responsibility we take seriously, and approach with enthusiasm and a strong commitment to helping Kingston achieve its goal of becoming Canada~s most sustainable city. I joined the planning profession in 2002, while working on my master~s degree in planning at the University of Guelph. Through undergraduate studies in environment and resource studies at the University of Waterloo, I developed a passion to understand all that contributes to making a strong community. The intersection of a community with a sense of place and where the natural environment, economy and culture thrive have all motivated my career significantly. I spent seven years working as a planning consultant for several consulting firms in Ontario with a focus on land use and environmental planning. In 2009, I took the position as the associate director of capital planning and sustainability at St. Lawrence College. During my time there, I oversaw the capital planning and space management portfolio for all three campuses, including infrastructure replacement and development of the college~s first sustainability plan. My experience working with the City of Kingston as a customer informs my work as part of the team responsible for providing that customer experience. Perhaps most important of all, I am a member of the community. Kingston has become home for my family over the last 10 years. The vitality and sustainability of our community is critical to ensuring that Kingston remains a place where we want to live, work, play and experience all that life has to offer.\n\nThe Downtown Action Plan is an infrastructure and urban design study for the entire downtown.

If you are signing a legal document that requires your oath, the content of that document is your sole responsibility.

{"prompt": "Contexts\n\n------\n\nIn line with the City\u2019s Updated Traffic Calming Policy, new traffic calming measures will be installed on local councilor selected streets across the City this spring. Councilors have selected each location based on feedback received from residents of their districts. These installations involve Type I (minor adjustment) traffic calming measures, such as flexible bollards, speed display devices, and painted road markings that encourage motorists to slow down and drive with caution. The design and selection of traffic calming measures consider the specific needs and challenges identified along with the local context and existing travel patterns. You can learn more about the City\u2019s Traffic Calming Design Guidelines here. Some Type I measures are temporary (e.g. flexible bollards) and must be removed and stored seasonally to accommodate winter road maintenance activities such as snowplowing. Temporary measures from previous years of the Traffic Calming program are re installed each spring alongside new projects. Many traffic calming implementations include flexible traffic calming bollards that are physically attached to the roadway. These bollards are used by many municipalities to improve road safety and are designed to introduce constriction points that encourage drivers to slow down. It\u2019s recommended not to park immediately adjacent to the bollards. However, in cases where only one vehicle can pass through due to closely parked vehicles, motorists should yield and proceed around the bollard with caution. While they are meant to be avoided, they may be driven over without causing damage to vehicles. Traffic calming bollards are removed to accommodate snow plowing and maintenance activities during the winter and are re installed in the spring. Additional details about new traffic calming installations planned for 2022 are below.

The City regards the Davis Tannery Lands as strategically important to redevelopment of the entire Inner Harbour neighbourhood, and on December 4, 2012, City Council agreed to undertake a preliminary planning exercise to examine redevelopment scenarios for the property, within the context of the Inner Harbour neighbourhood. In May 2013, the City held a workshop with stakeholders and the public. The outcome was the creation of a vision and goals for future development of the Davis Tannery Lands. The results of these sessions can be found in the report prepared by MHBC: Consultant Report  Redevelopment Vision Several studies were also commissioned by the City for the Davis Tannery property and the executive summaries are available in the Related Documents section. The Davis Tannery Lands are currently under private ownership and development applications are in process. Please check DASH for information about the status of development applications and approvals. The City no longer has an ownership interest in the former Davis Tannery property, but remains committed to supporting private developers seeking to remediate and redevelop this brownfield site. The former Davis Tannery property is strategically important to the redevelopment of the North King~s Town neighbourhood and the Inner Harbour waterfront and the property remains eligible to apply for tax assistance through the City~s Brownfield Community Improvement Program. The City~s Community Improvement Plan (CIP) for Brownfields provides a framework for the remediation and development of brownfield sites within a defined area (~Project Area~) that includes the Davis Tannery Lands and financial assistance may be available for the redevelopment of the former Tannery property. The City has many technical studies that describe the environmental, archeological and servicing aspects of the property.

After the initial spring sweeping is complete, crews perform routine street sweeping to remove debris from streets and curbs. Cycle lane sweeping is a priority in the spring and is scheduled throughout the year. Crews will respond to reports of sand, gravel, broken glass and other debris as required. Crews work three shifts per day, 24 hours, Monday to Friday until all streets are swept. Main streets are swept first, followed by residential streets which take approximately seven weeks to complete. Review the residential street schedule below to know when your street is scheduled for sweeping. Spring cleanup is the heaviest and most time consuming due to the accumulation of debris and winter sand through the fall, winter and spring. Where possible, median islands and adjacent sidewalks will be swept before the street sweepers make their pass. Often, more than one pass is required to sufficiently clean the street, and that~s why you typically will see two sweepers working together. The City approaches street sweeping as follows: We appreciate your patience as crews complete our annual spring street sweeping program.
